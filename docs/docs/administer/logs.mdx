## What Firezone Logs

Docker deployments of Firezone consist of 3 running containers:

| Container         | Function      | Example logs                                  |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ubuntu-firezone-1 | Web portal    | HTTP requests received and responses provided |
| ubuntu-postgres-1 | Database      |                                               |
| ubuntu-caddy-1    | Reverse proxy |                                               |

Each container stores logs as a JSON file on the host machine. These files are found at
`var/lib/docker/containers/{CONTAINER_ID}/{CONTAINER_ID}-json.log` and can be shown through the
`docker logs {CONTAINER}` command.

## Managing and Configuring Logs

By default, Firezone uses the `json-file` logging driver without
[additional configuration](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/). This means
logs from each container is stored separately in a file format designed to be exclusively accessed by
the Docker daemon. Log rotation is not enabled, so logs on the host can build up and consume excess
storage space.

For production deployments of Firezone you may want to configure how logs are collected and stored. Docker
provides [multiple mechanisms](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/)
to collect information from running containers and services.

Examples of popular plugins, configurations, and use cases are:

* Export container logs to
[Splunk](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/)
or
[Google Cloud Logging](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gcplogs/)
* Enable log rotation and max file size
* [Customize log driver output](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/log_tags/)

## Audit Logs

:::note
Audit logs are in early Beta on the Enterprise plan.

to learn more.
:::

Firezone maintains two types of logs tied to user identity: configuration logs and network activity logs.

Configuration logs track events related to the configuration of Firezone itself, either by admins or users.
Access logs track connections to protected resources made by users of your network.

Logged events are recorded as JSON objects and stored in the database. These are accessible via a
REST API or the Firezone portal, and exportable to CSV format.
