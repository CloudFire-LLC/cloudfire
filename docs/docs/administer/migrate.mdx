Chef Infra Client, the configuration system Chef Omnibus relies on, has been
scheduled for End-of-Life in 2024. As such, Omnibus-based deployments
will be deprecated in a future version of Firezone.

Follow this guide to migrate from an Omnibus-based deployment to a Docker-based
deployment. In most cases this can be done with minimal downtime and without
requiring you to regenerate WireGuard configurations for each device.
from Omnibus today, follow our [migration guide]().

Estimated time to complete: **2 hours**.

## Steps to Migrate

1. We recommend allocating about **2 hours** of downtime in case anything goes
   wrong. Most migrations will take much less than this, but the goal is to
   create a buffer for any unforeseen issues.
1. **Back up** your server. This ensure you have a working state to roll back to
   in case anything goes wrong. At a _bare minimum_ you'll want to back up the
   [file and directories Firezone uses
   ](../reference/file-and-directory-locations), but we recommend taking a full
   snapshot if possible.
