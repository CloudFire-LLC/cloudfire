Welcome to Firezone REST API v0 documentation.

## Getting started

To get started with the REST API, you'll first need an API token.
This can be generated in the UI at `/settings/account` or via the CLI
with:

```shell
docker compose -f $HOME/.firezone/docker-compose.yml exec firezone bin/create-api-token
```

**Note**: The token is written to `STDOUT` by default. You may wish to redirect its output
to a file instead:

```shell
docker compose -f $HOME/.firezone/docker-compose.yml exec firezone bin/create-api-token > fz_token
```

:::caution
API tokens generated from the CLI are owned by the primary administrator.
:::

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
