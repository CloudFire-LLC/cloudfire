## Backup and restore

Backing up Firezone primarily consists of backing up the appropriate files and directories
listed above and restoring them with the same permissions as before.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Docker" value="docker" default>

For Docker-based deployments, this will consist of backing up the `$HOME/.firezone`
directory along with the Postgres data directory, typically located at
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/firezone_postgres-data` if you're using the default
Docker compose template.

To restore, copy the files back to the original location. Be sure to
restore any other configuration as appropriate, such as any configuration
in `/etc/docker` or enabling on boot with `systemctl enable docker`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Omnibus" value="omnibus">

For **Omnibus-based** deployments, we recommend running a `firezone-ctl reconfigure`
after restoring the files and directories just to ensure everything is in a
consistent state.
