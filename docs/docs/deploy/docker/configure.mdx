Deployment and infrastructure-related configuration is managed with
[environment variables](../../reference/env-vars) that are loaded from your
`.env` or `docker-compose.yml` file. These require a service restart.

Docker-based deployments are configured through environment
variables passed to the `firezone` container. These can be
specified either in a `.env` file in the current directory,
the `docker-compose.yml` file, or passed to the `docker run`
call directly. See the [env var reference](../../reference/env-vars)
for a complete listing.

See [Docker's documentation
](https://docs.docker.com/compose/envvars-precedence/) for more information.
