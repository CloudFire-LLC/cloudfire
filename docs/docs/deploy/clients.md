Firezone is compatible with the official WireGuard clients available for all
major platforms. Installation instructions for each platform can be found on the
main WireGuard website here: [
https://www.wireguard.com/install/](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

Once the WireGuard client is installed, users can add the tunnel by
importing the `.conf` file sent by the administrator or logging into the
Firezone web UI and downloading a `.conf` file there.
