Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can be done via the Web UI.

Deployment and other infrastructure-related configuration is handled via
environment variables that are loaded from your configuration file (for
Omnibus-based deployments) or from your `docker-compose.yml` file (for
Docker-based deployments).

For Omnibus-based deployments, Firezone leverages [Chef Omnibus
](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) to handle release packaging, process
supervision, log management, and more.

The main configuration file is written in [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) and can
be found at `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb` on a default installation.
Changing this file **requires re-running** `sudo firezone-ctl reconfigure`
which triggers Chef to pick up the changes and apply them to the running
system.

For an exhaustive list of Omnibus configuration variables and their
descriptions, see the [configuration file reference
](../../reference/configuration-file).
