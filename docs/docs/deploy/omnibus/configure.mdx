Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can be done via the Web UI.

Deployment and other infrastructure-related configuration is handled via
environment variables that are loaded from your configuration file (for
Omnibus-based deployments) or from your `docker-compose.yml` file (for
Docker-based deployments).

Docker-based deployments are configured through environment
variables passed to the `firezone` container. These can be
specified either in a `.env` file in the current directory,
the `docker-compose.yml` file, or passed to the `docker run`
call directly.

See [Docker's documentation
](https://docs.docker.com/compose/envvars-precedence/) for more information.
