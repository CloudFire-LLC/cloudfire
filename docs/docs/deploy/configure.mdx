Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can be done via the Web UI or
REST API. See our [REST API documentation](../../reference/REST API) for more
details on managing runtime configuration of Firezone. This type of
configuration can be changed **with little to no downtime** in a production
deployment.

We're actively working to move more configuration variables to
this type of configuration, so expect more ENV vars to move to runtime
configuration in the future.
