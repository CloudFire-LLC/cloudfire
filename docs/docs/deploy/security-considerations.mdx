**Disclaimer**: Firezone is still beta software. The codebase has not yet
received a formal security audit. For highly sensitive and mission-critical
production deployments, we recommend limiting access to the web interface, as
detailed [below](#production-deployments).

## List of services and ports

Shown below is a table of default ports used by Firezone services.

## Production deployments

For production and public-facing deployments where a single administrator
will be responsible for generating and distributing device configurations to
end users, we advise you to consider limiting access to Firezone's publicly
exposed web UI (by default ports `443/tcp` and `80/tcp`)
and instead use the WireGuard tunnel itself to manage Firezone.

For example, assuming an administrator has generated a device configuration and
established a tunnel with local WireGuard address `10.3.2.2`, the following `ufw`
configuration would allow the administrator the ability to reach the Firezone web
UI on the default `10.3.2.1` tunnel address for the server's `wg-firezone`
interface:

```text
root@demo:~# ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), allow (routed)
New profiles: skip

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere
51820/udp                  ALLOW IN    Anywhere
Anywhere                   ALLOW IN    10.3.2.2
22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
51820/udp (v6)             ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

This would leave only `22/tcp` exposed for SSH access to manage the server
(optional), and `51820/udp` exposed in order to establish WireGuard tunnels.
