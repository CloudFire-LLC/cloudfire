Firezone uses Postgresql as its primary data store. AES-GCM encryption
is used to encrypt sensitive fields.

## Compatibility

Firezone should work fine on Postgres versions 9.6 and above, but we recommend
using the latest stable version whenever possible. If you find an issue with
your particular version of Postgres, [please open a GitHub issue
](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues).

In general, Firezone should also work fine using external Postgres-compatible
database services like Amazon RDS and CockroachDB. See the configuration section
below for more information configuring Firezone with an external DB.

:::warning
Configuring Firezone to use an external database can be complicated and
error-prone. We recommend using the bundled Postgres for Omnibus-based
deployments or the official Postgres Docker image for Docker-based deployments.
