# Local authentication (username & password)

By default, Firezone will use local email / password for authenticating users to
the Firezone portal. Administrators can add users and assign their passwords on
the `/users` page. See [Add users](/user-guides/add-users/) for more details.

:::note
Although local authentication is quick and easy to get started with, you can
limit attack surface by [disabling local authentication](#disabling-local-authentication)
altogether. See our [OIDC](/authenticate/oidc/) or [SAML](/authenticate/saml/) guides
for details.
:::

We recommend [enabling TOTP-based MFA](/authenticate/multi-factor/) for any
accounts that use the local authentication method.

## Disabling local authentication

Local authentication can be enabled or disabled from the `/settings/security` page.
If you've disabled local authentication and can no longer authenticate to the portal
to re-enable it, see our [troubleshooting guide
](/administer/troubleshoot#re-enable-local-authentication-via-cli) for re-enabling
local authentication from the CLI.
