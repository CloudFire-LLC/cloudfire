This guide will walk through using Firezone as a relay to connect
two peers. A typical use case for this configuration is to enable an
administrator to access a server, container, or machine that is normally
behind a NAT or firewall.

## General Case - Node to Node

This example demonstrates a simple scenario where a tunnel is established
between Peer A and Peer B.

In the settings for each device, ensure the following parameters are set to the
values listed below. You can edit device settings by clicking the `Edit` button
on the `settings/[device_id]/edit` page.
See [link to edit device article] for additional details on editing device settings.

Note `PersistentKeepalive` can also be set in on the
`/settings/defaults` page for all devices.

Peer A

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Peer B
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25` If the peer is behind a NAT, this ensures the peer
is able to keep the tunnel alive and continue to receive packets from the
WireGuard interface. Usually a value of `25` is sufficient, but you may need to
decrease this value depending on your environment.

Peer B

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.3/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Peer A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

## Admin Case - One to Many Nodes

This example demonstrates a scenario where Peer A can communicate
bi-directionally with Peers B through D. This configuration could represent an
administrator or engineer accessing multiple resources
(servers, containers, or machines) in different networks.

In the settings for each device, ensure the following parameters are set to the
values listed below. You can edit device settings by clicking the `Edit` button
on the `settings/[device_id]/edit` page.
See [link to edit device article] for additional details on editing device settings.

Peer A (Administrator Node)

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.3/32, 10.3.2.4/32, 10.3.2.5/32`: This is the IP of peers
B through D. Optionally you could set a range of IPs as long as it includes the
IPs of Peers B through D.
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25` If the peer is behind a NAT, this ensures the peer
is able to keep the tunnel alive and continue to receive packets from the
WireGuard interface. Usually a value of `25` is sufficient, but you may need to
decrease this value depending on your environment.

Peer B

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Peer A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

Peer C

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Peer A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`

Peer D

- `AllowedIPs = 10.3.2.2/32`: This is the IP or range of IPs of Peer A
- `PersistentKeepalive = 25`
