Once you have successfully installed Firezone you'll need to add users to grant
them access to your network. This is done through the Web UI.

## Web UI

Add a user by clicking the "Add User" button under `/users`. You will be asked
to specify an email and a password for the user. Firezone also offers other ways
to grant access to users in your organization. See
[Authenticate]({%link docs/authenticate/index.md%})
for more information.

These credentials will be used
to authenticate the user so they are able to establish the tunnel.
