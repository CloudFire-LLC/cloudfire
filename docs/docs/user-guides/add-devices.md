Once the tunnel profile is created, you can send the WireGuard configuration
file to the user by:

* **Shareable Link**: Generates a time limited link to the tunnel config file
that can be sent to the user.
* **Download Config**: Downloads the tunnel config file to your local machine
to be sent securely to the user.

Tunnels are associated with users. See [Add Users
]({% link docs/user-guides/add-users.md %}) for more information on how to add
a user.
