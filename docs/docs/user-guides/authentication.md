Firezone provides the ability to require authentication to establish VPN connections.

**Note**: To re-authenticate a VPN session, a user will need to turn off their
VPN connection and log in to the Firezone portal (URL specified during
[deployment]({%link docs/deploy/prerequisites.md%})
).

## Web Authentication (default)

Firezone will use the user's email address and password
to authenticate their VPN session.
You can set the session length to a minimum of 1 hour and maximum of 90 days.
Setting this to Never disables this setting, allowing VPN sessions indefinitely.
This is the default.
