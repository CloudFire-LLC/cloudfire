## Releasing

**Note**: The version for all published components is set from [scripts/Makefile](../scripts/Makefile).

### App Store clients (Apple/Android)

1. Go to Actions tab in GH and run the `Kotlin` or `Swift` workflow appropriately
1. This will push new release builds to Firebase or App Store Connect and pushed out Firebase App Distribution or TestFlight respectively.
1. Test this build manually a bit since we have no automated client tests yet
1. To submit for review:
   - For Apple, do this through AppStore connect. Details are [below](#apple-client).
   - Android, download the AAB from Firebase App Distribution, create a new release in Google Play Console, and upload the AAB.

### GitHub-released components (Linux, Windows, and Gateway)

Given that `main` is tested:

1. Go to the draft release of the component you want to publish
1. Double-check that the assets attached are from a recent CI and include the
   correct changes.
1. Publish the release. Tags and release name should be auto generated. This will trigger pushing Docker images to `ghcr.io`.
1. Open a PR and making the following changes.
1. Update [scripts/Makefile](../scripts/Makefile) with the new version number(s). Run `make -f scripts/Makefile version` to update the version in the Makefile.
1. Update the Changelog (e.g. `../website/src/components/Changelog/GUI.tsx`) with the new version number(s) and release notes.
1. Update the known issues in `website/src/app/kb/user-guides/*`
1. When the PR merges, the website will now redirect to the new version(s).

This results in a gap where GitHub knows about the release but nobody else does.
This is okay because we can undo the GitHub release, and it prevents any queued PRs
from landing in the release while you execute this process.

### Apple Client

- Log in to the following URL: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/
- Go to Apps
- Go to Firezone
- Click on TestFlight
  - Note: You can't delete a `Version` in TestFlight
- There is "internal testing" and "external testing"
  - "internal testing" is only the Firezone team
  - "external testing" is the beta customers
- Click on the testing group you want to release to and on the testing group
  page:
  - Click the `+` on the `Builds` sections
  - Select the build you want to push out
  - Check the `Automatically notify testers`
  - Type a description of what you want users to see in the notification sent to
    users (e.g. a small change log of what's in this release)
  - Click `Submit for Review`
    - Then you have to wait for it to be reviewed (has been a matter of minutes
      as of late)

(Alternative way to push out a release)

- After login go to `Builds` (select either ios/macos)
- Find the `Version` section you want to release and drop down to show list of
  builds
- Find the build you want to push out, hover over the `Groups` column and select
  the `+` icon
- From here it's the same as the instructions above to type a description,
  etc...

## Breaking API changes

We should notify customers **2 weeks in advance** for any API-breaking changes.
