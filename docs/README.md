# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

## Installation

```shell
yarn
```

## Local Development

```shell
yarn run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```shell
yarn run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Deployment happens automatically when a new version is published. See the
`publish_docs` CI workflow.
