        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In December, Firezone organized an off-site in California. Here's what we learned.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first tech job was at <a href="https://www.strong.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong</a>, a workout journal app that was pretty popular at the time. The founders were “digital nomads,” and the team was fully remote.</p><p>Back in 2016, this was highly uncommon.</p><p>We spent a lot of time creating processes to work together effectively on opposite sides of the world. One of these was meeting up in person regularly.</p><center><img loading="lazy" width="800" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/211626078-6f64a4f4-ec37-40cd-8bb5-a6b9b122f351.png" alt="digital nomads" class="img_ev3q"></center><p>At first, it was by accident. Since everyone was traveling anyway, we would coordinate being in the same city at the same time.</p><p>After working in person, we quickly noticed the way we worked remotely improved. People were more comfortable sharing their ideas, better at giving constructive criticism, and happier in general.</p><p>It just <em>felt</em> better to work together in person.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-try-this-at-firezone">Why try this at Firezone?<a href="#why-try-this-at-firezone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why try this at Firezone?" title="Direct link to Why try this at Firezone?">​</a></h2><p>If you believe Firezone can take a sizable bite out of the usual suspects of legacy remote access products, we’ll need to use every advantage.</p><p>As a startup, our biggest advantage is the ability to move quickly as a team.</p><p>This is much easier when everyone is comfortable sharing ideas and engaging in lively debate. Plus, it’s a lot more fun.</p><p>So we decided to try it out. After much planning, canceled bookings, and a few long flights, our team met in Santa Rosa, California.</p><center><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/216130487-bde66005-e3e0-4d88-a2d0-f9a842efc715.png" alt="offsite office" class="img_ev3q"></center><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-did-we-do">What did we do?<a href="#what-did-we-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did we do?" title="Direct link to What did we do?">​</a></h2><p>Our itinerary included architecture planning, a multi-day hackathon, and plenty of fun activities around the Bay Area.</p><center><img loading="lazy" width="600" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/211988059-02f3083a-116b-462e-a5ff-90af4fab63fc.png" alt="offsite office" class="img_ev3q"></center><p>The focus of the off-site was building. We each defined a few tasks that could realistically be completed by the end of the trip. So what did we work on?</p><ul><li>A new Firezone gateway (coming in 0.8!) that will eventually allow decoupling the web portal from the WireGuard data plane. A single Firezone web portal will soon be able to manage hundreds or even thousands of little Firezone gateways securing access to their respective private resources. More details to come!</li><li>A <a href="https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new REST API in 0.7</a> to allow configuring Firezone in a more automatable way. Users love our snappy web portal, but nothing beats the power of an API for automation.</li><li>Various documentation improvements to improve consistency between Omnibus and Docker sections, detail logging, and implement a v1 style guide.</li></ul><p>Of course, no visit to the Bay Area would be complete without a tour of San Francisco. It rained most of the time, so we missed out on much of the picturesque hiking. But we still managed to snap some photos of the Golden Gate bridge and devour a few In-N-Out burgers.</p><p>Of special mention are the team dinners. Remote companies lack that familiar bond typically formed over team lunches in the office, so we sought to recreate that when we met in person. As an added bonus, we also split cooking duties. In many ways preparing food for your teammates is like opening a pull request: make something, request feedback on it, then merge and enjoy.</p><p>As someone whose culinary talents rival his passion for building security products, our resident chef <a href="https://twitter.com/jamilbk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamil</a> led most of the culinary endeavors, including a 2-hour drive around Santa Rosa in search of live Dungeness crab.</p><center><img loading="lazy" width="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167144/214394961-ecbff7d8-2f9c-48a6-a906-c387366169f3.jpeg" alt="team dinner" class="img_ev3q"></center><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lessons-learned-for-next-time">Lessons learned for next time<a href="#lessons-learned-for-next-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lessons learned for next time" title="Direct link to Lessons learned for next time">​</a></h2><p>Since this was our first off-site, some things could have gone better. Here’s a small list of hiccups and other things we’d do differently next time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="turn-on-low-power-mode">Turn on low power mode<a href="#turn-on-low-power-mode" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Turn on low power mode" title="Direct link to Turn on low power mode">​</a></h3><center><img loading="lazy" width="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/211503302-4b2e2e74-06e8-4929-aa5b-a336af25a450.png" alt="team dinner" class="img_ev3q"></center><p>If you’re booking an Airbnb, check for planned maintenance and outages! We were notified three days before arrival the power would be out during two full workdays.</p><p>Fortunately, we had a small power bank and mobile hotspot with unlimited data. Unfortunately, our lead Rust engineer’s beefy Linux machine only gets a single hour of battery life on a full charge.</p><p>When his machine died, we migrated to our local coffee shop, where power and WiFi were surprisingly abundant. <em>Editor’s note: Coffee shops in Santa Rosa are much more accommodating as a makeshift office than most in San Francisco.</em></p><p>When you’re building software, electricity and internet are vital -- splurge for that bigger battery bank and faster hotspot!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lumbar-support-is-underrated">Lumbar support is underrated<a href="#lumbar-support-is-underrated" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lumbar support is underrated" title="Direct link to Lumbar support is underrated">​</a></h3><p>You’ll sacrifice some ergonomics when you work out of an Airbnb. Put a premium on large work surfaces, open common areas, and comfortable chairs. After a few days of working hunched over on a sofa, we learned the hard way.</p><p>Even better, leave heads down work until after the off-site. Instead, prioritize architecture discussions, brainstorming sessions, and design sprints.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stock-the-right-fuel">Stock the right fuel<a href="#stock-the-right-fuel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stock the right fuel" title="Direct link to Stock the right fuel">​</a></h3><p>We got carried away at Costco. Our out-of-town guests had never witnessed the spectacle of an American snack aisle. Fortunately, our talented engineers can turn Funyuns into elegant lines of Rust code (shoutout <a href="https://github.com/conectado" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Gabi</a>).</p><p>All jokes aside, you’ll need the right fuel for your hackathons and deep product discussions. We recommend stocking up with plenty of coffee and healthy snacks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plan-ahead-itll-pay-off">Plan ahead: it’ll pay off<a href="#plan-ahead-itll-pay-off" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Plan ahead: it’ll pay off" title="Direct link to Plan ahead: it’ll pay off">​</a></h3><p>As is often the case with startups, we planned the trip on short notice. This meant many last-minute restaurant bookings and trips to the store for basic supplies.</p><p>So, make a shopping list, book a few restaurants in advance, and have a backup plan. If you’re looking for a template, take a look at this <a href="https://posthog.com/handbook/company/offsites#how-to-plan-an-offsite-in-8-weeks---a-checklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guide</a> from our friends at PostHog. A great checklist is hard to beat.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-next">What’s next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What’s next?" title="Direct link to What’s next?">​</a></h2><p>In a few short days, we:</p><ul><li>Aligned on Firezone’s product direction</li><li>Made critical architecture decisions for the gateway and client apps</li><li>Made significant progress on a few key features</li><li>Bonded over great food, conversation, and Mario Kart</li></ul><p>We could have accomplished some of these over a few long Zoom calls and chat threads, but not as quickly. There’s something about mind melding over a few days of intense work that’s hard to replicate.</p><p>So, will we have another off-site? Definitely!</p><p>Until next time!</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>👋 thanks for reading</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Firezone secures remote access to private resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firezone 0.6 Released!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="firezone-06-released">Firezone 0.6 Released!<a href="#firezone-06-released" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Firezone 0.6 Released!" title="Direct link to Firezone 0.6 Released!">​</a></h2><p>Today, I'm excited to announce we've closed the <a href="https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first public issue
</a> on our GitHub repository,
more than a year after it was originally opened: Containerization support!
We're also releasing preliminary support for SAML 2.0 identity providers
like Okta and OneLogin.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="docker-support">Docker Support<a href="#docker-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Docker Support" title="Direct link to Docker Support">​</a></h3><p>Docker is now the preferred method for deploying Firezone. Our <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_install.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
automatic install script</a>
now uses Docker by default, and we even have a new <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_migrate.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker migration script
</a>
that will non-destructively migrate your Omnibus-based Firezone installation
to a Docker-based one with minimal downtime.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-deploy">How to Deploy<a href="#how-to-deploy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to Deploy" title="Direct link to How to Deploy">​</a></h4><p>You can now deploy Firezone complete with valid SSL certificates and a
provisioned administrator in just a couple minutes:</p><div>Loading...</div><p>This also means Firezone runs on any platform that supports Docker,
like my Mac in the video above. The automatic install script will <em>probably</em>
barf on Windows, though. In that case, try the
<a href="/docs/deploy/docker/#option-2-manual-install">manual install method</a>!</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-docker">Why Docker?<a href="#why-docker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Docker?" title="Direct link to Why Docker?">​</a></h4><p>Docker offers a number of benefits over the old Omnibus-based method of deploying
Firezone:</p><ul><li><strong>Simpler, more robust upgrades</strong>: In most cases, simply pull the latest <code>firezone/firezone</code>
image and restart the container.</li><li><strong>Simpler configuration</strong>: Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can now
be done in the web UI instead of the <code>/etc/firezone/firezone.rb</code> configuration
file. All other configuration variables can be specified as ENV vars to the
Firezone container.</li><li><strong>Smaller footprint</strong>: The Firezone image weighs in at a couple dozen
megabytes versus hundreds of megabytes for the Omnibus package.</li><li><strong>Portability</strong>: Firezone now runs on any platform that supports Docker.</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: Containerization providers better security isolation than
simply running as an unprivileged local user.</li></ul><p>It also makes it easier to build and test Firezone. CI pipelines rejoice!
No more 4-hour long compiles and intermittent build failures.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-about-omnibus">What about Omnibus?<a href="#what-about-omnibus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What about Omnibus?" title="Direct link to What about Omnibus?">​</a></h4><p><a href="https://github.com/chef/omnibus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chef Omnibus</a> is a Ruby-based build system
designed to make building and distributing complex software easier. You define
your dependencies as source tarballs, configure options, and platform-specific
build flags, and Omnibus automatically fetches, builds, and links all your
dependencies automagically, emitting an OS-native installer artifact when
complete.</p><p>Omnibus was a popular choice for distributing self-hosted software before
Docker was popular -- GitLab and Mattermost are two popular self-hosted products
that still support Omnibus-based deployments today. It's still used in many
cases where Docker can't be used (on the <!-- -->*<!-- -->BSDs, for example).</p><p>But, since Omnibus is <a href="https://docs.chef.io/versions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effectively EOL in 2024</a>
due to its reliance on Chef Infra Client, we've decided to deprioritize
reliance on it, and dedicate those resources to containerized deployments
instead.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Beginning with 0.6, Omnibus support in Firezone is <strong>deprecated</strong>.
We'll be removing support for it completely in a future Firezone release.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-migrate-from-omnibus-to-docker">How to migrate from Omnibus to Docker<a href="#how-to-migrate-from-omnibus-to-docker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to migrate from Omnibus to Docker" title="Direct link to How to migrate from Omnibus to Docker">​</a></h4><p>We've written an in-depth migration guide to migrate your instance from Omnibus
to Docker:</p><p><a href="https://www.firezone.dev/docs/administer/migrate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.firezone.dev/docs/administer/migrate</a></p><p>Most instances will migrate without issue. If you're running Firezone in production
for your team or business, <a href="/contact/support/">contact us</a>
so we can better understand how we can help with your migration.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="saml-20">SAML 2.0<a href="#saml-20" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to SAML 2.0" title="Direct link to SAML 2.0">​</a></h3><p>Also in 0.6 is preliminary support for SAML 2.0 authentication. You'll need the
IdP Metadata XML document to set it up. In most cases the identity provider
will provide it for you. If not, you should be able to build it manually or
using a tool such as
<a href="https://www.samltool.com/idp_metadata.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this nifty online IdP builder</a>.</p><p>In general we recommend using OpenID Connect integration over SAML whenever possible.
It's simpler, tends to be implemented more consistently across identity providers,
and much easier to debug when things go wrong.</p><p>Speaking of OIDC, 0.6 also introduces a couple improvements to make integrating
your identity provider a more pleasant experience:</p><ul><li><code>auto_create_oidc_users</code> is now a per-provider configuration setting. Enable or disable
autocreation of users when logging into Firezone via that provider.</li><li>New web form for entering OIDC details, with improved validation and error checking:</li></ul><center><img loading="lazy" width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167144/196735853-b2c8d505-285f-40ac-9d73-4b568358c5c3.png" alt="OIDC Form" class="img_ev3q"></center><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="idp-not-supported">IdP not supported?<a href="#idp-not-supported" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IdP not supported?" title="Direct link to IdP not supported?">​</a></h4><p>If your IdP isn't supported or you'd like to learn about your options for
custom integrations, <a href="/contact/support/">contact us</a> to learn more about custom integrations.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firezone 0.5 Released!]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="firezone-05-released">Firezone 0.5 Released!<a href="#firezone-05-released" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Firezone 0.5 Released!" title="Direct link to Firezone 0.5 Released!">​</a></h2><p>As the first post on our new blog, we thought it'd be fitting to kick things
off with a release announcement. So without further ado, we're excited to
announce: Firezone <a href="https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.5.0 is
here</a>! &nbsp;It's packed with new
features, bug fixes, and other improvements — more on that below.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-scoped-egress-rules">User-scoped egress rules<a href="#user-scoped-egress-rules" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User-scoped egress rules" title="Direct link to User-scoped egress rules">​</a></h3><p>Rules can now optionally receive a user scope, limiting the rule's application
only to devices owned by that user. This allows you to selectively allow or
deny traffic from a particular user to an IP, set of IPs, or CIDR range.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="auto-renewed-ecdsa-backed-acme-powered-ssl-certificates">Auto-renewed, ECDSA-backed, ACME-powered SSL certificates<a href="#auto-renewed-ecdsa-backed-acme-powered-ssl-certificates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Auto-renewed, ECDSA-backed, ACME-powered SSL certificates" title="Direct link to Auto-renewed, ECDSA-backed, ACME-powered SSL certificates">​</a></h3><p>One of our most-requested features is now available — Firezone 0.5.0 supports
ACME SSL certificate renewal backed by Let's Encrypt's new ECDSA key type.
Other providers and key types are available too. See all ACME configuration
options in our <a href="/docs/reference/configuration-file/">configuration file
reference</a>.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: ACME is disabled by default to remain compatible with existing
Firezone installations. To enable, set the following in your config file:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">default['firezone']['ssl']['acme']['enabled'] = true</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_y97N" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="byorp-bring-your-own-reverse-proxy">BYORP: Bring Your Own Reverse Proxy<a href="#byorp-bring-your-own-reverse-proxy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to BYORP: Bring Your Own Reverse Proxy" title="Direct link to BYORP: Bring Your Own Reverse Proxy">​</a></h3><p>Want to disable Nginx and deploy Firezone under your own reverse proxy or HTTP
load balancer? Well, now you can! We've documented the required headers and
other configuration necessary to make this happen. <a href="/docs/deploy/advanced/reverse-proxy/">Check the
docs</a> for some configuration
examples for popular proxies. In short:</p><p>Set the
<code>default['firezone']['phoenix']['external_trusted_proxies']</code>
configuration variable to a comma-separated list containing the proxies
you'd like to receive forwarded requests from. If your proxy uses an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC1918 address</a>, add its
IP to <code>default['firezone']['phoenix']['private_clients']</code> instead of
<code>default['firezone']['phoenix']['external_trusted_proxies']</code>.
Update your proxy's configuration to point to Firezone, making sure to set
the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header and enable WebSocket connection upgrades.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> ACME support is tied to Nginx. If you disable the bundled
Firezone Nginx service, you'll need to provide your own SSL certificates
(or configure ACME renewal manually).</p><p><strong>Additional note:</strong> If you go this route, you'll need to terminate SSL
yourself — Firezone sets the secure attribute on all cookies and thus
requires the downstream proxy to terminate SSL.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="runtime-configuration-available-in-the-ui">Runtime configuration available in the UI<a href="#runtime-configuration-available-in-the-ui" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Runtime configuration available in the UI" title="Direct link to Runtime configuration available in the UI">​</a></h3><p>Some Firezone configuration settings are now configurable in the product UI
under the Security settings. This will override anything you have set in the
config file. Moving runtime configuration into the application itself brings us
a step closer to Docker-based deployments (coming Soon™).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-and-improved-documentation">New and improved documentation<a href="#new-and-improved-documentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New and improved documentation" title="Direct link to New and improved documentation">​</a></h3><p>Our docs have been migrated from Jekyll to <a href="https://docusaurus.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a>.
Aside from all the Formatting is improved, user guides are updated and many
pages have been edited for clarify and further detail. As an added bonus, our
docs are feature improved search thanks to the powerful search functionality
provided by <a href="https://docsearch.algolia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DocSearch by Algolia</a>.
Contributions welcome!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="red-hat-and-debian-package-repositories">Red Hat and Debian package repositories<a href="#red-hat-and-debian-package-repositories" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Red Hat and Debian package repositories" title="Direct link to Red Hat and Debian package repositories">​</a></h3><p>If you're on one of our <a href="/docs/deploy/omnibus/supported-platforms/">supported
distros</a> (or its
derivatives), the one-line install script will automatically install Firezone
from our package repository and track further updates from there. This means
your Firezone installation can be managed like any other package on your system
and will be marked for upgrades by the same apt and yum tools you're already
familiar with. Be sure to check the <a href="/docs/administer/upgrade/">upgrade
notes</a> prior to each

package sizes to be reduced even further moving forward.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-landing-page-logo">Custom landing page logo<a href="#custom-landing-page-logo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom landing page logo" title="Direct link to Custom landing page logo">​</a></h3><p>In the first round of what we hope to be the start of a full-featured
