  This function returns a query to fetch next available IP address, it works in 2 steps:

  1. It starts by forward-scanning starting for available addresses at `offset` in a given `network_cidr`
  up to the end of CIDR range;

  2. If forward-scan failed, scan backwards from the offset (exclusive) to start of CIDR range.

  During the search, addresses occupied by other devices or reserved are skipped.

  We also exclude first (X.X.X.0) and last (broadcast) address in a CIDR from a search range,
  to prevent issues with legacy firewalls that consider them "class C" space network addresses.
