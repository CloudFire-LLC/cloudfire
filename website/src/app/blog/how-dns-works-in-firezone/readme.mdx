Firezone's approach to DNS works a bit differently than one might expect. One
question we get a lot is, "why do my DNS Resources resolve to different IPs with
Firezone enabled?". Great question. Let's explain that now.

What follows is a quick recap of how DNS works, a couple of the security issues
it faces, and how Firezone's DNS-based traffic routing was designed to address
them.

## Quick recap: DNS

Before we dive into all the fun details, let's briefly cover how DNS works.

At a high level, DNS is a hierarchical system that distributes the
responsibility of resolving a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to a series of
nameservers, each one responsible for resolving a different part.

<p className="text-sm italic text-center mx-auto">Figure 1: How DNS works</p>

Here's an abbreviated summary of how it works:

1. An application makes a query. The first stop is the **stub resolver**, a
   small piece of software on the host that's responsible for resolving all DNS
   queries on the system.
1. The stub resolver forwards the query to an **upstream resolver**. This is
   typically a caching resolver run by your ISP (or more recently, a public DNS
   service like NextDNS or Cloudflare).
1. If the query misses the cache, the upstream resolver begins the full process
   of resolution. It forwards the query to a series of successive
   **nameservers** -- first the **root nameserver**, then the **TLD
   nameserver**, and finally the **authoritative nameserver**, each one
   responsible for resolving a different part of the FQDN.
1. The authoritative nameserver responds with the IP address of the host in
   question, and the upstream resolver returns the final answer to the stub
   resolver on the host that originally made the query.
1. The application on the host can now connect to the IP address returned by the
   stub resolver.

On today's internet, the whole process for resolving a query typically takes a
few hundred milliseconds. Caching resolvers help to speed this up by storing the
results of queries for a certain amount of time, known as the record's
time-to-live (TTL). So if a host makes the same query multiple times, the
upstream resolver can return the result immediately (assuming the TTL hasn't
expired) without having to query the hierarchy of root, TLD, and authoritative
nameservers again. This can speed up query times by orders of magnitude, to the
point where upstream resolvers responding with cached responses are nearly
instantaneous.

DNS works today almost exactly as it did when it was first introduced to the
ARPANET in the early 1980s. But the internet has changed a lot since then, and
security issues have emerged that the original design didn't account for.

### Security issues with DNS

The thing is, DNS was designed when the ARPANET was a small, trusted network of
research institutions and government agencies. The system was designed with the
assumption that all entities on the network were known, and that the network
itself was secure.

As the ARPANET grew to become the internet, however, this assumption no longer
held. Two security issues in particular have become popular tools in the
attacker's arsenal since DNS was first introduced: **DNS spoofing** and **DNS
enumeration**.

#### DNS spoofing

One of the security issues immediately apparent with DNS is you have to trust
the nameservers you're querying. If a malicious actor manages to compromise any
part of the path between you and a nameserver, they can return false responses
to your queries. Since your machine has no other way to verify the authoritative
answer, it will happily connect to whatever IP address the malicious nameserver
returned. This is known as a
[DNS spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_spoofing) attack.

In recent years, various solutions have been created that, when used properly,
render this mostly a solved problem.
[DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions)
ensures the integrity of responses to your query, and
[DNS-over-TLS (DoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_TLS) and
[DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) take this a
step further and prevent eavesdroppers from seeing which queries you perform.

#### DNS enumeration

The above solutions work well for protecting the answers to your queries, but
what about protecting your nameservers from the queries themselves?

If an organization defines records for its internal services, for example,
anyone can query its authoritative nameservers to map out a list of all the
organization's internal services. How convenient!

This is known as **DNS enumeration**, and is a common first step taken by a
malicious actor looking for potential entrypoints into an organization. Because
of this issue, organizations often resort to running their own nameservers,
configured to return different results (or sometimes none at all) depending on
the _source_ of the request. This technique is known as **Split DNS**.

## How Split DNS works

[Split DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-horizon_DNS) is a technique
wherein an orgnization maintains two (or more) separate nameservers (or a single
one configured with two "zones") -- one for internal resources and one for
external resources. The internal server is only accessible to users who are
connected to an organization's internal network (such as a VPN or branch office
network), while the external server is accessible to the outside world.

  className="mx-auto"
/>

<p className="text-sm italic text-center mx-auto">
  Figure 2: How Split DNS works
</p>

As an example, let's say an organization has an internal service called
`gitlab.company.com` which lives at the internal address `10.10.10.10`. The
organization's internal nameserver would be configured to respond to queries for
this service to VPN or branch office workers, but the external nameserver would
simply return `NXDOMAIN`, DNS speak for "not found". This allows the
organization to publish some records publicly, like `www.company.com` so that
its website is accessible to the public, while leaving the addresses of its
private resources a secret.

All that's left is to sprinkle a little bit of DNS configuration onto your
workforce's machines to make sure the right server is being queried for the
right domains, and you're set.

Split DNS is a great building block for organizations looking to secure access
to their own internal applications, and continues to be a popular way to
mitigate enumeration attacks today.

### Limitations of Split DNS

Split DNS works great when you have a clear distinction between external and
internal resources. It allows you to publish public addresses for your public
resources so anyone can access them, and publish private addresses for your
workforce so they can connect to the private resources that you manage.

Increasingly, however, cloud-delivered services are replacing their on-premise
equivalents across many organizations. The upside here is generally lower
operational cost -- pay the businesses making the software to host it for you as
opposed to hosting and managing it yourself, and reap the efficiency benefits in
the form of cost reduction.

But the downside is resources that were once internal are now publicly exposed.
Anyone with the right credentials can access your organization's code
repositories, CRM data, or CI/CD secrets from anywhere in the world. Since these
services are now available publicly, they no longer have internal addresses, and
without internal addresses to resolve to, Split DNS isn't as helpful anymore.

Is there another way to secure access to these services?

#### A naive solution

As it turns out, there's a solution to this problem that's becoming more common
these days: IP allowlists. Many third-party SaaS apps like GitHub, Slack, and
Hubspot allow you to configure a list of source IP addresses that are allowed to
access the service.

<Image

  height={1200}
  className="mx-auto"
/>

<p className="text-sm text-center mx-auto italic">
  Figure 3: IP allowlist protecting access to www.github.com
</p>

Now, some readers will have already recognized the solution to our public
exposure problem: route your workforce's traffic for these services through a
VPN jumphost or office router, egress the traffic through a static IP added to
your SaaS provider's allowlist, and problem solved, right?

Well, kind of. There's just one issue with the above approach: **virtual
hosting**.

[Virtual hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting) is a technique
used to host multiple services at a single IP address. It's become an essential
tool in the arsenal to fight IPv4 address exhaustion, and is often used in IPv6
networks as well.

If we simply resolve `github.com` and then configure our VPN to route traffic
for that IP address through the jumphost, we might inadvertently route traffic
for `gist.github.com`, `api.github.com`, or `raw.githubusercontent.com` too!

<Image

  alt="Collateral damage from naive IP routing"
  width={1200}
  height={1200}
  className="mx-auto"
/>

<p className="text-sm text-center mx-auto italic">
  Figure 4: Collateral damage may occur if you naively route resolved IPs
</p>

This creates a problem: any service that shares its IP address with other
services can't be secured using a naive IP allowlist approach.

#### NAT to the rescue

So we can't simply resolve service IP addresses and route them as-is. We need to
translate them somehow to make sure they don't conflict with the resolved
addresses for services we _don't_ wish to route. Enter NAT: Network Address
Translation.

We can solve the problem above by intecepting the DNS query to the service,
generating a unique IP address for it instead of the actual one, and then add a
bit of NAT after the jumphost to convert the generated IP address back to the
actual IP address of the service.

This solves the collateral damage problem of routing traffic for the wrong
service, but it introduces a new problem: we need a way to intercept DNS queries
for the services we're trying to secure, generate a unique IP for them
on-the-fly, and then somehow route the associated traffic through a properly
configured NAT gateway to the service in question.

/>

<p className="text-sm text-center mx-auto italic">
  Figure 5: DNS interception + NAT gateway: problem solved?
</p>

Seems complicated doesn't it? Keeping all of this in sync and up-to-date would
be a configuration nightmare. We've taken what was originally a DNS problem and
translated it to a configuration problem. But lucky for us, configuration
problems tend to be more solvable.

## DNS-based traffic routing

And we're finally to the part where Firezone comes in.

Firezone's approach to DNS was designed to combine the benefits of Split DNS for
internal services with the routing benefits for IP-allowlisted public services.
Let's see how.

### How it works

Remember the stub resolver we introduced earlier? Recall that it's a small piece
of software on the host that's responsible for resolving all DNS queries on the
system. Well, each Firezone Client embeds a tiny, lightweight stub resolver that
works just like the one your operating system provides, but with a special
twist.

For DNS queries that don't match any of your Firezone-defined Resources, it
operates like any other stub resolver, forwarding the query to your system's
default nameservers as if Firezone didn't exist. For DNS queries that do match a
defined Resource, however, it behaves a bit differently.

Instead of forwarding the query to your default nameservers, our special stub
resolver generates a special, internal IP for the Resource and responds
immediately with that, storing the IP in a lookup table.

Upon seeing packets through the tunnel matching the IP in the lookup table, the
Client generates a request to the Policy Engine to authorize the traffic. If
approved, the Policy Engine forwards the IP and DNS name corresponding to the
Resource to a Gateway that's available to serve the Resource.

The Gateway then resolves the actual IP address for the Resource (using _its_
stub resolver) and stores a mapping between it and the special, internal IP we
generated earlier.

When the Gateway sees traffic for the special, internal IP, it translates
translates it back to the actual IP of the Resource and forwards the traffic
along to the Resource.

  className="mx-auto"
/>

<p className="text-sm text-center mx-auto italic">
  Figure 6: Firezone's DNS-based traffic routing
</p>

Now, as the application sends packets to the dummy IP, they're routed through
the newly established Firezone tunnel to the Gateway that resolved the query.
The Gateway then forwards this traffic on to the public service, setting the
source address to the static IP we've configured in the service's allowlist
(achieving the NAT function mentioned earlier), and we've now routed traffic to
the service through Firezone without affecting any other services that share its
IP.

All of this happens in about the same time it would take for a query to be
resolved without Firezone, so the application (and end user) are none the wiser.

The query is resolved over a secure WebSocket transport via Firezone's control
plane, protecting against the spoofing attack mentioned earlier. And since the
actual resolution takes place on the Gateway running in your protected
environment, enumeration attacks are also mitigated.

All that's left is to add the Gateway's IP address to the service's allowlist,
and you've now routed your traffic for the service through Firezone without the
collateral damage problem we covered above.

### How it's implemented

We glossed over lots of details above. The section below gets a bit more
technical, so if you're not interested in the nitty-gritty details, feel free to
skip ahead to the [conclusion](#conclusion). If you are, well, let's dive a
little deeper.

#### Query interception

The process described above actually starts when you sign in to the Firezone
Client. When this happens, the Client reads which nameservers are available on
the host (from `/etc/resolv.conf` for example), generates corresponding
**sentinel addresses** for each one, and then configures the host's operating
system to use these as the host's default nameservers instead.

For each IPv4 and IPv6 nameserver it finds on the host, the Client generates a
matching sentinel address in the `100.100.111.0/24` and
`fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0/120` ranges for IPv4 and IPv6 nameservers,
respectively. This is why you'll often see `nameserver 100.100.111.1` as one of
your upstream resolvers in `/etc/resolv.conf` while the Client is connected.

A nice side effect of this one-to-one mapping approach is that it won't affect
the selection algorithm your operating system uses to pick healthy nameservers
-- if one is down, the corresponding sentinel address will be unresponsive, and
the operating system will pick another, responsive sentinel to use instead.

##### Custom nameservers

As we were building all this, we thought of another feature that might be useful
to organizations. Instead of using the host's default nameservers to forward
non-matching queries to, we allow the admin to specify them in the Firezone
admin portal instead. The Client will then generate sentinel addresses for these
nameservers and use them instead of the host's for all other queries on the
system.

This is useful for protecting queries that _don't_ go through Firezone. For
example, you can configure a DNS filtering provider to
[block malicious DNS queries](/kb/use-cases/secure-dns) across your workforce.
Or you could point it to your organization's internal nameservers to resolve
internal services like a more traditional Split DNS configuration.

#### Generating the mappings

Ok, so that covers how queries are intercepted, but how does the stub resolver
generate the dummy IP addresses? Let's step through an example to illustrate.

In this example, the admin wants to secure access to Slack, but the process
works the same for any third-party SaaS service.

1. An admin defines a DNS Resource with address `*.slack.com` in the Firezone
   admin portal. Notice the wildcard -- this will route all subdomains for Slack
   through Firezone as well, which helps ensure all relevant Slack traffic is
   routed.
1. The admin then defines a corresponding Policy with the Groups that should
   have access.
1. All connected Clients affected by the Policy will immediately receive the new
   Resource definition.
1. Upon receiving the Resource definition, the Client configures the stub
   resolver to begin intercepting queries for `*.slack.com`.
1. When it sees a match, the stub resolver forwards the query to the Policy
   Engine, which reauthorizes the query and finds a healthy Gateway to resolve
   it.
1. The Gateway resolves the query, taking note of which Client asked it, and
   then returns all of the resolved IP addresses for the query to the stub
   resolver in the Client.
1. The stub resolver then generates a unique, mapped IP address for each
   resolved IP address, and the Client adds these addresses to the host's
   routing table.
1. The stub resolver returns the mapped IP addresses to the application on the
   host that made the query.
1. The application then begins sending packets to the dummy IP address, where
   they're routed through a newly-established WireGuard tunnel to Gateway we
   just resolved the query with.

Similar to the way the sentinel addresses work above, the stub resolver
generates a single IPv4 or IPv6 address for _each_ resolved IP address returned
by the Gateway, picking a sequential address from the `100.96.0.0/11` and
`fd00:2021:1111:8000::/107` ranges to to map `A` and `AAAA` records
respectively. This ensures that things like timeout behavior and round-robin DNS
continue to function with Firezone enabled just as they did before, without
affecting applications.

## Conclusion

So now you know where those strange IPs are coming from -- within the Client
itself. Now when you `dig` a service and get a response that looks like
`100.96.X.X`, you can be sure Firezone is working to secure access to it.

We could go on for some time about all the fun edge cases that arise from doing
this sort of thing, but we'll stop here. If you _really_ want a peek under the
hood at how all this works, it's all open source --
