# How Firezone DNS Works

_Note: This blog post describes in detail how Firezone DNS works in all its
complexity. If you're looking for a more high-level reference, read the
[docs page on the subject instead](/kb/deploy/dns)._

When a user signs in, the Firezone Client configures its host operating system
to use a special, lightweight DNS proxy running inside the Client for all DNS
queries on the system.

This proxy lives at `100.100.111.0/24` for IPv4 queries and
`fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0/120` for IPv6 queries. These addresses are
not routable on the public internet and are only used for DNS queries.

The IP addresses the proxy chooses to "listen on" are determined by the
[upstream resolvers](#configuring-client-dns-upstream-resolvers) available to
the Client. For each IPv4 upstream resolver, the proxy listens on an address in
the `100.100.111.0/24` range, and for each IPv6 upstream resolver, the proxy
listens on an address in the `fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0/120` range.

When an application makes a DNS query, the proxy checks if the name matches a
Firezone Resource that the user has access to. If it does, the Client then
requests a Gateway serving that Resource to resolve the DNS query. When the
Gateway responds, the proxy will create a temporary mapping between the actual
IP address of the Resource and the dummy IP address it returned to the
application. From this point onward, all subsequent packets to the dummy IP
address are forwarded to the Gateway that resolved the query. These IPs are
persisted for the duration of the Client's session.

immediately responds with appropriate dummy IPs in the `100.64.96.0/11` and
`fd00:2021:1111:8000/108` range and returns these to the application making the
query. These IPs are remembered for the duration of the Client's session and
used to intelligently route subsequent packets to a Firezone Gateway suitable
for serving that Resource.

If the proxy sees a query for a name that **is not** a Firezone Resource that
the user has access to, it will forward the query to the upstream DNS server(s)
configured by the admin in `Settings` -> `DNS`. If no upstream DNS servers are
configured, the query is forwarded to the Client device's default system
resolver(s) instead.

This means that Clients are automatically configured for Split DNS in Firezone
-- no other configuration is necessary other than adding the desired Resources
in the admin portal.
