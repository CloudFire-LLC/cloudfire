-- A lead Tauri developer

When I joined Firezone around the end of 2023, we needed a GUI framework to port
the Firezone Client software to Windows. We
[chose Tauri over other frameworks](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/2715)
because it was the fastest way to get the product working. Now Tauri is the
framework for both the Linux and Windows GUI Clients.

[**Tauri**](https://tauri.app/) is "a framework for building tiny, blazingly
fast binaries for all major desktop platforms." It's like
[Electron](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)>)
except:

- The backend is Rust, not node.js / C++
- The webview is provided by the OS or package manager, not bundled with the app
- Because it doesn't bundle Chromium, the apps are under 100 MB to download

The Firezone team already knew web programming, and our cross-platform
connection library `connlib` is written in Rust, so Tauri didn't present any
huge learning curve - It's just more Rust.

We considered several other frameworks and rejected them all for now:

| Framework                                                                 | Positives                                                  | Negatives                                                                                                    |

# What's so good about Tauri?

## Tauri is easy to learn and use

Growth solves everything.

Software grows when it is easy to use. Being easy attracts beginners, and turns
beginners into advanced users and contributors. Python became popular by
appealing to new programmers who needed to write small programs. JavaScript
became popular by being pre-installed in every web browser. C++ became popular
by being published before both of them.

Tauri makes itself easy by shipping the `create-tauri-app` tool for setting up
boilerplate projects, and by having bundlers for Windows `.msi` installers and
Debian `.deb` packages that Just Work, at least for simple programs.

<AsciinemaPlayer

  autoplay={false}

  idleTimeLimit={3}
  preload={true}
/>

Using Tauri, we got the Windows Client to beta in about 2 months, including the
time needed for me to learn about `connlib`, and for the team to change our auth
flow from one that worked well on macOS to one that worked on all platforms.
This has been my first project using Tauri, and the pace of development has been
great.

Bringing the Linux GUI Client to MVP took another 4 months. This took longer
than Windows because Linux's security model required us to split the Client into
two processes, and because we refactored the Windows Client to share the code
with Linux.

## We already use Rust and TypeScript

Firezone already uses Rust for our data plane (the Gateway, the Relay, and
`connlib`) and TypeScript for the website and admin portal, so we didn't have to
add another language like C++ or C# to the mix. I made a prototype of the GUI in
TypeScript, hooked it up to the Rust code, and then let another team member
polish and style it to match the website branding.

The TypeScript / JavaScript inside the web view can call into `async` Rust
functions, and from there we have access to the usual Tokio facilities like mpsc
channels, tasks, etc., to perform work before returning to JavaScript.

e.g. [`apply_advanced_settings`]() writes the new settings to disk using Tokio's
`fs` module, then sends them to the central `Controller` over a channel. If the
`Controller` is backed up for any reason, the TypeScript will asynchronously
wait on the Rust code.

[TypeScript calling the function (settings.ts#L84-L90)](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/37b3bc2047f6918adecda4108708b9ba9f76b84b/rust/gui-client/src/settings.ts#L84-L90)

```ts
invoke("apply_advanced_settings", {
  settings: {
    auth_base_url: authBaseUrlInput.value,
    api_url: apiUrlInput.value,
    log_filter: logFilterInput.value,
  },
});
```

[The Rust implementation (settings.rs#L47-L61)](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/37b3bc2047f6918adecda4108708b9ba9f76b84b/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/src/client/settings.rs#L47-L61)

```rust
#[tauri::command]
pub(crate) async fn apply_advanced_settings(
    managed: tauri::State<'_, Managed>,
    settings: AdvancedSettings,
) -> Result<(), String> {
    if managed.inner().inject_faults {
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    }
    apply_inner(&managed.ctlr_tx, settings)
        .await
        .map_err(|e| e.to_string())?;

    Ok(())
}
```

Tauri automatically serializes and deserializes both ways as long as our types
implement the common `serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}` traits, which we
`derive`:

[settings.rs#L12](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/37b3bc2047f6918adecda4108708b9ba9f76b84b/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/src/client/settings.rs#L12)

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Deserialize, Serialize)]
pub(crate) struct AdvancedSettings {
    pub auth_base_url: Url,
    pub api_url: Url,
    pub log_filter: String,
}
```

## Tauri comes with batteries included

The requirements for the beta Windows Client included:

- A system tray icon and menu
- Pop-up "toast" notifications such as "Firezone is connected"
- A plan for automatic updates
- A plan for a Linux port
- The ability to handle
  [deep links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_deep_linking) from web
  browsers, like how Steam or Zoom can be triggered by links

Tauri has built-in modules for a
[system tray menu](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.6.7/tauri/struct.SystemTrayMenu.html),
[notifications](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.6.7/tauri/api/notification/struct.Notification.html),
and [self-updates](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.6.7/tauri/updater/index.html), and it
has a `.deb` [bundler for Linux](https://tauri.app/v1/api/config/#debconfig)
built in. For deep links we used
[tauri-plugin-deep-link](https://crates.io/crates/tauri-plugin-deep-link).

This made it easy to commit to Tauri - We knew that worst-case, we had
_something_ that would work for a beta release.

Some of those batteries stayed in and some got replaced. We replaced the default
Tauri notifications on Windows with `tauri-winrt-notification`, we rewrote the
deep link code, we haven't deployed self-updates yet, and the system tray menu
will be replaced eventually.

Over the last 6 months Tauri's built-in features have saved us:

- From using system tray and notification APIs directly
- From starting from scratch for deep linking
- From writing an updater at all

# How does Tauri work for us?

```text
Firezone Client
    |
    +------> Tokio
    |
    +------> connlib
    |
    +------> Tauri
```

The Firezone Client for Linux and Windows is a wrapper around our cross-platform
connection library `connlib`. Tauri provides the GUI and bundling, and then we
use [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio), the popular async runtime for
Rust, to glue everything together.

## Tauri = TAO + WRY

```text
Tauri
  |
  +----> Tokio
  |
  +----> WRY
  |       |
  |       +----> WebView2 (Windows)
  |       |
  |       +----> webkit2gtk (Linux)
  |
  +----> TAO
          |
          +----> Win32 (Windows)
          |
          +----> GTK+ (Linux)
```

Tauri internally uses Tokio too. Below that, it's built on
[WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry) and
[TAO](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao), two sibling projects also maintained
by the Tauri Programme.

TAO is a "window creation library". It opens windows and runs a minimal event
loop, just enough for WRY, the "webview rendering library", to spawn a webview
inside each window and run the GUI.

WRY uses platform-specific web views like `webkit2gtk` on Linux and
[WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2) on
Windows.

WebView2 and WebKit2 are similar from a bird's-eye view. There's a main UI
process, such as the Firezone Client or a web browser, and then multiple worker
processes to render web views. In a web browser these processes might map to
individual tabs. In Tauri they map to individual windows.

```text
UI process
    |
    +--------> WebContent process
    |
    +--------> WebContent process
    |
    +--------> WebContent process
```

(Paraphrased from
[webkit.org](https://docs.webkit.org/Getting%20Started/Introduction.html#what-is-webkit))

The two engines are essentially cousins as well:

- In 2001, [Apple forked KHTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit#Origins) to
  make WebKit, the browser engine for Safari.
- In 2008, Chromium 1.0 released, based on a
  [multi-process branch of WebKit](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Architecture>)
- In 2013, Chromium forked WebKit and named it
  [Blink](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)>)
- In 2015, Microsoft released
  [Edge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge) using an engine that no
  longer exists
- In 2020, Microsoft released the new Edge, built atop Chromium, and they
  released
  [WebView2](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/10/19/edge-webview2-general-availability/)

So WebView2 is an API for Microsoft Edge, which is Google Chromium, based on
Google Blink, which was WebKit, meant for Apple Safari, originally KDE KHTML.

## Bundling ðŸ“¦

Tauri's bundlers were a huge selling point for us. It turns out `.deb` packages
are easy to make, but making a good `.msi` installer requires some boilerplate.
We originally wanted to ship a portable single-file executable, but two
requirements made that impractical on both platforms:

- Controlling DNS and running connlib requires admin / sudo privileges. We don't
  want admin privilege to be a requirement for day-to-day use of Firezone, so we
  install a service that has the right privileges, and that service takes
  commands from the GUI. Installing a service from a portable executable makes
  it not portable.
- The webview libraries are shared on both platforms, so if the system doesn't
  have them installed, we'd have to take admin privilege to install them on the
  first run of the GUI, which is not convenient, and doesn't match how Debian /
  Ubuntu want to install packages.

For Linux (Ubuntu), Tauri creates a `.deb` package. This package references
webkit2gtk, so `apt` will install it for us when Firezone is installed, share it
with other software on the system, and upgrade it when security patches are
released.

```text
deb package
    |
    +----> firezone-client-gui
    |
    +----> systemd service
    |
    +----> HTML+JS+CSS assets
    |
    +----> dependency on webkit2gtk
```

For Windows, Tauri creates an `.msi` installer, which automatically downloads
and installs WebView2 if the system doesn't have it already. Windows 11 systems
have WebView2 pre-installed, and just like `apt` on Ubuntu, we let Windows
handle the security updates.

```text
MSI installer
    |
    +----> firezone-client-gui.exe
    |
    +----> Windows service
    |
    +----> HTML+JS+CSS assets
    |
    +----> WebView2 downloader
```

Firezone Client 1.0.5 is **12 MB on Linux** and **8 MB on Windows**, much
smaller than the default ~100 MB for Electron, and still a bit smaller than the
~35 MB achievable with
[electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder).
Another API could have made it smaller, but considering how little effort it
takes to use Tauri, the download size is certainly near the Pareto front.

# If Tauri is so great, why did the Linux port take twice as long as Windows?

The Linux port took twice as long because running a GUI with `sudo` in Linux
doesn't seem to work, and we need root permissions to control DNS. On Windows,
the early releases were just one process running with admin privilege. (Not
counting the WebView renderer processes)

```text
+---------------------------+
|    Tauri GUI process      |
|                           |
|   +-------------------+   |
|   |      connlib      |   |
|   +-------------------+   |
+---------------------------+
```

When we ported that to Linux, everything broke.

The tray icon
[didn't appear on some Ubuntu versions](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/4053),
so we couldn't click "Sign in", and when it did appear, we
[couldn't open a browser anyway](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/4103),
because the desktop is expecting us to be a normal user and the GUI was running
as `root`.

So we gave up on that model and split the program into 2 top-level processes:

1. A GUI running as the normal desktop user
2. A systemd service running as root, with lots of sandboxing.

```text
+-----------------------+                                             +-------------------+
|   Tauri GUI process   | <------ Inter-process communication ------> |      connlib      |
+-----------------------+                                             +-------------------+
```

We had originally planned to do this refactor _after_ the Linux GUI beta, but
the permissions problem forced us to give it higher priority.

This is a security win for two reasons. First, it puts a boundary between a
million lines of web engine code and our cryptography code. Second, systemd's
sandboxing in
[firezone-client-ipc.service](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/37b3bc2047f6918adecda4108708b9ba9f76b84b/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/deb_files/firezone-client-ipc.service)
means that the code running as root can't accidentally
[read your email](https://xkcd.com/1200/),
[delete the entire filesystem](https://hackaday.com/2024/01/20/how-a-steam-bug-once-deleted-all-of-someones-user-data/),
or even
[change the time on the system clock](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/37b3bc2047f6918adecda4108708b9ba9f76b84b/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/deb_files/firezone-client-ipc.service#L19).

We copied this architecture to Windows, where it coincidentally fixed a bug
where
[our DNS control didn't deactivate](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/4899)
if the system powered off suddenly or Firezone was force-stopped.

The Windows sandboxing is not as strict as systemd's, but on both platforms this
change was also:

- A convenience win, because you can run Firezone without admin privilege, and
- A bug-fixing win because the service can clean up Firezone's DNS control if
  the GUI crashes or the computer suddenly reboots.

So we got everything we wanted, just not in the order we wanted it.

# What non-Tauri issues did we have?

## Web views use a whole bunch of RAM

<Link href="/images/blog/using-tauri/lots-of-ram.png" target="_blank">
  <Image
    width={1598}
    height={952}
    src="/images/blog/using-tauri/lots-of-ram.png"
    alt="Windows Task Manager showing that the webviews need about 100 MB of RAM to do nothing"
  />
</Link>

The GUI uses about 100 MB of RAM even with all windows hidden. This seems to be
the minimum for keeping the web view process alive. It's okay for an MVP, but
it's still 5% of the 2 GB needed for a minimum Ubuntu desktop, just to run a GUI
that will be closed most of the time.

We can't fix this right now, but we have at least 3 long-term options:

1. Try closing the windows instead of just hiding them
2. Only use the main GUI process to run the tray menu, and keep the Tauri
   windows in a subprocess that we can stop and restart when needed
3. Switch away from Tauri entirely. Iced uses about half as much RAM, and GTK+
   also has some Windows support and some Rust support.

Hopefully some of that 100 MB is code pages we can share with Edge and other
WebView2 apps, but I suspect most of it is HTML and JS overhead.

## Ubuntu forwards and backwards compatibility is hard

Ubuntu 20.04 and 24.04 don't have any `webkit2gtk` versions in common.

|              | `webkit2gtk` 4.0 | `webkit2gtk` 4.1 |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | X                |                  |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | X                | X                |
| Ubuntu 24.04 |                  | X                |

It's not possible to link with both 4.0 and 4.1, so it's impractical to make one
exe that runs on all 3 of the Ubuntu versions we'd like to support. This is a
common problem in Linux GUI programs.

In fact, at time of writing, Tauri 1.x
[just doesn't work on Ubuntu 24.04](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/9662)
unless you cheat and add another repo to install the 4.0 package from. Tauri
2.x, still in beta, won't work on 20.04 since it requires 4.1.

Tauri does offer an AppImage option to bundle the webview, but this increases
the download size from ~10 MB to ~100 MB, we can't install our connlib service
if we're running from an AppImage, and AppImages built on 20.04 have rendering
bugs on 24.04 anyway.

Switching to another GUI framework might work, but since GTK+ is already
involved in this incompatibility issue, it's likely that GTK+ itself has some
compatibility problems we'd hit. We'd have to spend time playing with it before
committing to a port. We also tried building an example Iced app on Ubuntu
20.04, and it didn't render on 24.04 either. Maybe it's something related to the
recent Wayland cut-over.

There is a plan that _should_ work, and it doesn't have any big leaps of faith,
but it's still painful:

- Refactor the code so that we can build for both Tauri 1.x and Tauri 2.x.
  (Needed sooner or later anyway)
- Use Docker or something to build one `.deb` inside 20.04 and another inside
  22.04. (Or worst case, two entire VMs)
- Unpack the two packages, add a Bash script shim that checks which WebKit is
  installed and launches the correct binary, then re-pack them into a single
  `.deb`. (We already re-pack Tauri's `.deb`, so this should be possible)

Or maybe we can install 4.1 on 20.04 somehow. Whatever we do, it won't be
simple. Worst case, we can give up and use Electron.

## WebView2 just doesn't install sometimes

This is an upstream issue with WebView2 for Windows. Sometimes the installer
times out in our GitHub CI runners and we don't know why.

## GNOME

On GNOME, if the menu is too long and the screen is too short, you can't open
submenus. If the menu is barely too long, the submenus open but they're squashed
into a tiny scroll view. And the submenus are shown in-line, so at no point does
it look like a submenu at all:

On Windows, it's fine. It's been fine since Windows 95, and it's still fine.

Also in GNOME, clicking on a notification runs another instance of the app.
Maybe this is intended to activate the app, but it doesn't seem to happen on
Windows. The second instance doesn't get any obvious environment variable or
argument to hint that it was launched from a notification, so we show a generic
"Firezone is already running" error instead of doing anything useful. If we
change that error to do nothing, then users will be confused if they try to run
Firezone and don't notice it's already running.

# What Tauri-related issues did we have?

## The Tauri directory layout is odd

The root of a Tauri project, such as
[`/rust/gui-client` in the Firezone repo](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/tree/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client),
has two subdirectories: `src` and `src-tauri`. The entire Rust project is
contained in `src-tauri`, and the `src` directory contains files for the web
view. `Cargo.toml` and `tauri.conf.json` are in `src-tauri`. I find this
confusing. Maybe Tauri's intended use case is to wrap up web apps into native
apps, so the web content gets to be in `src` and the Rust code is isolated over
in `src-tauri`.

But we think of the Firezone Client as a Rust program that incidentally uses
HTML+JS+CSS for the GUI, so this layout is backwards for us. We were expecting a
top-level `/Cargo.toml`, with the Rust code under `/src`, and the web files
under `/src-web` or something. There's probably a good reason why Tauri does
this, but we aren't sure what that reason is.

## Tauri's deb bundler is not very customizable

To install the systemd service on Linux, we need the deb package to have
[post-install](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/deb_files/postinst)
and
[pre-remove](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/deb_files/prerm)
scripts. `dpkg` doesn't install these in the filesystem, it runs them from a
temp directory when adding or removing a package, and then it deletes them.
Tauri doesn't have any hook for these scripts, since a typical self-contained
GUI app won't need them.

So in Firezone's build process, we
[delete Tauri's `.deb`, add our scripts to the intermediate files Tauri left, and then finish the bundling ourselves.](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/build.sh#L20-L39)

              +----> prerm
```

`cargo-deb`
[does support these scripts](https://github.com/kornelski/cargo-deb?tab=readme-ov-file#packagemetadatadeb-options),
but Tauri's bundler is based on
[`cargo-bundle`](https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle) instead.

I'm surprised these scripts are not in Tauri's use cases. On Windows, we
[override Tauri's Wix files](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json#L44-L45)
to generate an MSI that installs and configures our connlib service. So in both
cases we had to hijack the build process a little. Linux required more code,
Windows required more "ChatGPT, tell me how Wix works, please."

## You can't left-click on the tray menu in Windows

In Windows, you can't left-click on the tray menu. Tauri doesn't fire any event
for it, even though other Windows apps handle left clicks just fine. You have to
right-click on Tauri system trays in Windows.

## Tauri apps can't exit gracefully

They can't. From `main` you decide when to start Tauri, but the only way to exit
Tauri is to call `std::process::exit`, or let Tauri call it for you.

This is implemented down in `tao`, Tauri's windowing library, for both
[Linux](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/blob/f9f81f2fd761c60abb5b46a6469864562a811c6d/src/platform_impl/linux/event_loop.rs#L913)
and
[Windows](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/blob/f9f81f2fd761c60abb5b46a6469864562a811c6d/src/platform_impl/windows/event_loop.rs#L219).

This might be due to some platform-specific limitation, such as Windows'
`WinMain` function or the fact that some OSes require all GUI-related function
calls to happen on "the main thread", or at least on a single thread.

Interestingly, `tao` is a fork of `winit`, and `winit` is able to return from
[its run function](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/struct.EventLoop.html#method.run_app)
on desktop.

The
[`run_iteration` function](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.6.6/tauri/struct.App.html#method.run_iteration)
should be able to handle this, but instead
[it busy-loops](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8631).

Commenting on these issues, lead Tauri developer Fabian said he also expects
better from the underlying OSes and this causes him to
["cry (himself) to sleep at night ðŸ¤·"](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8631#issuecomment-1898328992)
Me too, Fabian. Me too.

## Setting binary names is tricky

On Linux our GUI is named `firezone-client-gui`, and so is our package.

We want:

1. The `.desktop` file to display our name as "Firezone Client", so it's
   human-friendly,
1. The package to be `firezone-client-gui`, so that it's distinct from our CLI
   Client
1. The GUI binary to be `/usr/bin/firezone-client-gui`,
1. And the service binary to be
   `/usr/lib/$ARCH/dev.firezone.client/firezone-client-ipc`, to keep it out of
   `$PATH`.

But Tauri's default is to name the first 3 the same and to put all binaries in
`/usr/bin`. We could fix this when we tear apart the `.deb` for the post-install
script, but I'd rather have a way to cut around the defaults and take control of
the bundler directly, like with the Wix files on Windows.

This is a case where Tauri doesn't reach "Easy things are simple, hard things
are possible."

## Initializing Tauri is flaky in CI... maybe?

> I think it's getting stuck on creating the GTK event loop for the window

At first we tried to initialize as much of the program as possible before
starting Tauri, and then move objects into the Tauri context. But we hit this
issue, which appears to be a race in initializing the GTK+ event loop or
something. It's arcane stuff 3 layers below us (Tauri, then `tao`, then GTK+) in
C code, so the workaround for now is to initialize Tauri immediately and do all
our own setup within the Tauri context.

It may not be Tauri's fault, but it's disappointing because it's nice to keep
control of `main` longer before handing control to Tauri and doing everything
inside callbacks.

# Conclusion

Tauri often feels like the training wheels on a bicycle. It gets you started,
but after a while you can't go any further without replacing it.

The positives are:

- It's Rust, so we get to keep all our code even if we completely ditch Tauri
  next year.
- Those training wheels are _very_ nice to have on a new cross-platform GUI
  project.
- It's gratis and libre, so you can't beat it on price.

The final word is, **Tauri is good, try it out.**
