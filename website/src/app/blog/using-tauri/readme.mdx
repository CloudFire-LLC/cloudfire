# What is Tauri and why do we use it?

[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is "a framework for building tiny, blazingly fast
binaries for all major desktop platforms." Similar to Electron, it uses a web
view to run the GUI. Unlike Electron, it doesn't bundle the web view, resulting
in smaller downloads, and it has native APIs for Rust instead of C/C++.

We
[chose Tauri over other frameworks](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/2715)
because it was the fastest way to get the product working on Linux and Windows.
The team already has experience with HTML/JS/CSS and our cross-platform
connection library `connlib` is written in Rust.

These other frameworks and libraries were considered and rejected for now. They
might be reconsidered in the future:

- Qt - Quality of Rust bindings unknown, typically distributed with lots of
  separate DLL files.
- FLTK - Difficult to style, very "batteries not included"
- GTK+ - Quality of Rust bindings unknown, quality of Windows support unknown
- Win32 API - Verbose, complicated, documentation is confusing, not portable to
  Linux
- native-windows-gui - Not popular enough / not maintained
- WinForms / WPF - Binding to C# assumed to be difficult

# What is good about Tauri?

## Tauri is easy to use

Using Tauri for the first time, I got the Windows Client to MVP in about 2
months, and the Linux Client to MVP in another 4 months. Linux took longer
because its security model required us to split the Client into a privileged
tunnel service and un-privileged GUI.

(TODO: Screenshots of the Windows and Linux MVPs)

Software that is easy for beginners to use ends up attracting beginners and
turning them into experienced users and contributors. The Rust language
deliberately took advantage of this, shipping the beginner-friendly Cargo
package manager from Rust 1.0 and shipping Clippy a few years later in 2018.

Tauri does the same thing, shipping the `tauri-cli` tool for setting up
boilerplate projects, and package bundlers for Windows `.msi` installers and
Debian `.deb` packages that Just Work, at least for simple programs.

## It's Rust and TypeScript

Firezone already uses Rust for the data plane (the Gateway, the Relay, and
`connlib`) and TypeScript for the website and admin portal. I don't know much
web design, so using TypeScript allowed me to make a rough prototype of the GUI
and then let other team members polish and style it to match the website
branding.

JavaScript inside the web view can call into `async` Rust functions (TODO: Code
example), and from there we can use `tokio`'s mpsc channels to send events to a
central controller task. (TODO: Code)

# What snags did we hit?

Overall, I like Tauri a lot. This section is longer because there are lots of
little details. "It's good" is shorter than "We had trouble because..."

## The Tauri directory layout is odd

The root of a Tauri project, such as
[`/rust/gui-client` in the Firezone repo](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/tree/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client),
has two subdirectories: `src` and `src-tauri`. The entire Rust project is
contained in `src-tauri`, and the `src` directory contains files for the web
view. `Cargo.toml` and `tauri.conf.json` are in `src-tauri`. I find this
confusing. I think Tauri's primary purpose is to wrap up web apps into native
apps, so the Rust code is sequestered in `src-tauri`, and the project is
supposed to be an NPM project that incidentally contains a Rust wrapper.

I think of the Firezone Client as a Rust GUI program that incidentally uses
HTML+JS+CSS for the GUI, so this layout is backwards to me. I would have
expected a top-level `/Cargo.toml`, with the Rust under `/src`, and the web
files under `/src-web` or similar. Maybe there's a reason for this, but I'm not
aware of it.

## Linux doesn't like running GUIs with root permissions

This isn't Tauri's fault. The Windows Client, at first, ran with admin
privileges so that it can open the secure tunnel and control the system's DNS.

After Windows was working, I got it to compile on Linux, with the Windows code
configured out, but almost nothing worked - Blank windows, missing tray icons,
etc.

It turns out that getting the environment right to run a GUI with sudo was
difficult. We knew that running a GUI with root powers was risky anyway. Even
though we're not loading untrusted web pages like a web browser is, we would
still be running a JIT _somewhere_ due to WebKit, and we would still be mixing
code for the secure tunnel and code for reading config files in the same
process. It also meant that ordinary users couldn't run Firezone, which is a
problem in corporate environments where users may not have sudo on their
desktops.

So we pushed back the Linux GUI release until it could be split into 2
processes, then we did the same split on Windows for the same reasons. This
means we lost the "download and run" property of having a single exe, since they
both install a background service, but the security and convenience of the GUI
Clients are both improved.

## Tauri's deb bundler is not very customizable

To install the systemd service on Linux, we need the deb package to have
[post-install](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/deb_files/postinst)
and
[pre-remove](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/deb_files/prerm)
scripts. `dpkg` doesn't install these in the filesystem, it runs them when
adding or removing a package, and then it deletes them. Tauri allows us to
bundle arbitrary files for installation in the filesystem, and we use that to
install
[the systemd service and a system group](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json#L23-L26),
but it doesn't have any hook for these special scripts.

So in Firezone's build process, we
[delete Tauri's deb, add our scripts to the intermediate files Tauri left, and then finish the bundling ourselves.](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/build.sh#L20-L39)

I'm surprised these scripts are not in Tauri's use cases. On Windows, Tauri
allows us to install and configure our background service by
[overriding the Wix files](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/blob/2a1187bd9c4d12960ef0000df1b6bd9bb361bf10/rust/gui-client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json#L44-L45)
that generate the MSI.

`cargo-deb`
[does allow these scripts](https://github.com/kornelski/cargo-deb?tab=readme-ov-file#packagemetadatadeb-options),
but Tauri's bundler is based on
[`cargo-bundle`](https://github.com/burtonageo/cargo-bundle) instead, which
doesn't appear to support the scripts.

## The tray menu works, but it's odd

In Windows, you can't left-click on the tray menu. Tauri doesn't seem to fire
any event for it. This is not a limitation of Windows, so I'm not sure why Tauri
only allows right clicks.

On GNOME, if the menu is too long and the screen is too short, you can't open
submenus. (TODO: Screenshots)

Also in GNOME, clicking on a notification runs another instance of the app. I
assume this is intended to activate the app, but it doesn't seem to happen on
Windows. (On Windows, we already worked around Tauri's default notifications
with
[tauri-winrt-notification](https://crates.io/crates/tauri-winrt-notification),
since Tauri's default notifications aren't clickable.) I'm not sure if the
second instance gets any environment variable or argument to hint that it was
launched from a notification, so we show a generic "Firezone is already running"
error instead of doing anything useful.

## Tauri apps can't exit gracefully

Not kidding. From `main` you decide when to start Tauri, but the only way to
exit Tauri is to let it call `std::process::exit`.

This is implemented down in `tao`, Tauri's windowing library, for both
[Linux](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/blob/f9f81f2fd761c60abb5b46a6469864562a811c6d/src/platform_impl/linux/event_loop.rs#L913)
and
[Windows](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao/blob/f9f81f2fd761c60abb5b46a6469864562a811c6d/src/platform_impl/windows/event_loop.rs#L219).

I first suspected this is due to some platform-specific limitation, such as
Windows' `WinMain` function or the fact that some OSes require all GUI-related
function calls to happen on "the main thread", or at least on a single thread.

`tao` is a fork of `winit`, and `winit` is able to return from
[its run function](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/struct.EventLoop.html#method.run_app)
on desktop.

The
[`run_iteration` function](https://docs.rs/tauri/1.6.6/tauri/struct.App.html#method.run_iteration)
should be able to handle this, but instead it busy-loops.

When asked about these issues, lead Tauri developer Fabian said he also expects
better from the underlying OSes and this causes him to
["cry (himself) to sleep at night 🤷"](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/8631#issuecomment-1898328992)
Me too, Fabian, me too. /s
