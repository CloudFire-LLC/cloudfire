              When we launched on Hacker News nearly two years ago, we never
              envisioned Firezone to be more than a simple tool for managing
              your WireGuard configurations.

            Today, I'm excited to announce we've closed the first public issue
            on our GitHub repository, more than a year after it was originally
            opened: Containerization support! We're also releasing preliminary
            support for SAML 2.0 identity providers like Okta and OneLogin.

            As the first post on our new blog, we thought it'd be fitting to
            kick things off with a release announcement. So without further ado,
            we're excited to announce: Firezone 0.5.0 is here! It's packed with
            new features, bug fixes, and other improvements — more on that
            below.
