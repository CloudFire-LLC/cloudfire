Blog ideas and brainstorming and outlining

# Ideas

- Tauri
- DNS control
- Desktop integration as a whole

# Tauri

- Other GUI frameworks we considered
- How I expect GUIs to work, based on experience with Qt and FLTK
- Good stuff
  - We still control `main`
  - Small packages
  - Pre-made deb and MSI bundlers
  - Easy to write almost everything in Rust and use TypeScript for the UI
  - Generally easy to work with and not restrictive
- Snags (For each one, explain how we worked around it, whether it was really a
  problem with Tauri, which it rarely is)
  - Required directory layout is a little weird
  - Admin / sudo working on Windows but not Linux
  - Deb bundler not as customizable as we need
  - Can't left-click on the tray menu in Windows
  - Tray menu and notifications generally short of features
    - The GNOME menu is just wacky
    - Clicking a notification in GNOME opens another instance of your app
  - Impossible to exit the event loop gracefully
  - Web views seem to occupy RAM even when the window is closed
  - Depending on Ubuntu's webkit package means forwards and backwards compat is
    hard
  - Setting the name of binaries and the bundle is tricky
  - Bug #3972, unknown flaky smoke test resolved by initializing Tauri sooner
  - WebView2 is flaky in CI #4981

# DNS control

- Windows NRPT
- Windows, Shelling out vs. using the API
  - APIs are poorly documented and rarely have safe Rust wrappers
  - Shelling out is slow and opens you to possible shell injection attacks
- That Windows DNS bug we had a while back
- Known gaps in our DNS control
- Linux methods
- Why `/etc/resolv.conf` is weird inside Docker
- How this would all work if we were a NetworkManager / Windows VPN plugin but
  that's hard to do

# Desktop integration as a whole

Title ideas:

- "Making desktop apps"

A little bit of everything I've worked on in my first 6 months:

- Invoke Cunningham's Law
- Tauri
- Crash handling
- DNS control
- The credential keyring
  - On Linux
  - On Windows
  - Why it makes some sense for OSes to have "app" as a first-class object, even
    though I don't love that
  - I still wish that the parameters that are ignored on specific OSes were
    treated as compile-time or run-time errors and not as just prose in the docs
- IPC on Linux and Windows
  - Deep links
    - Alternatives
  - Windows bug #5143 with named pipes
  - Unix domain socket ownership
- DNS change / network change listening
- Auto-starting the IPC service and the GUI
  - Systemd sandboxing
- Well-known directories
- Things we haven't gotten to
  - Internationalization / localization
  - End-to-end automated tests
