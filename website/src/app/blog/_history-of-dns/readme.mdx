## A brief history lesson

But before we dive into all the fun details, it's helpful to first understand
the problem DNS was originally designed to solve.

DNS was created in the early 1980s to address a classic scalability problem with
the early ARPANET.

The [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), the precursor to the
modern internet, was a network of computers that connected various research
institutions and government agencies across the United States. It was the first
network to use the new TCP/IP protocol suite, which provided an IP address to
each host on the network.

To connect to a host on the ARPANET, you needed its IP address. To avoid having
to remember the IP address of each host you wanted to connect to, a simple
system was created to map each address to a human-friendly "hostname".

Hostname to IP address mappings were kept in a single file, aptly named
`HOSTS.TXT`, and stored on the `SRI-NIC` server -- a system maintained by the
Network Information Center (NIC) at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI).

Simple enough, right? Well, not quite. The system was perhaps a bit _too_
simple.

### Files don't scale

Whenever an ARPANET member organization (yes, you had to be a member at that
time) wanted to add a host to the file or update its IP address, it had to
contact the SRI (during standard business hours!) and file a formal request
containing the updated mapping.

Need to make an update over the weekend or on a US holiday? Too bad, you were
out of luck! The system worked ok when there were only a handful of hosts to
maintain. But, as you can imagine, it became increasingly unmanageable as more
hosts joined.

## Enter the Domain Name System (DNS)

Over the course of several meetings, early ARPANET engineers (who would later go
on to form the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)) devised a clever solution to the
scalability problem they were facing: instead of storing the hostname lookup
table in a single `HOSTS.TXT` file, they would chop it up instead and distribute
the entries across several _Nameservers_, each one responsible for maintaining
the hosts that belonged to a particular network, or _Domain_.

Hence the name: the Domain Name System, or DNS for short.

### How DNS works

At a high level, DNS is a hierarchical system that distributes the
responsibility of resolving a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) to a series of
nameservers, each one responsible for resolving a different part.

<p className="text-sm italic text-center mx-auto">Figure 3: How DNS works</p>

Here's a quick summary of how it works:

1. An application makes a query. The first stop is the **stub resolver**, a
   small piece of software on the host that's responsible for resolving DNS
   queries.
1. The stub resolver typically maintains a small cache of recent queries. If the
   query misses the cache, it forwards the query to an **upstream resolver**.
   This is like the stub resolver but with a much larger cache and run by your
   ISP (or more recently, a public DNS service like NextDNS or Cloudflare).
1. If _this_ query misses the cache, the upstream resolver begins the full
   process of resolution. It starts by forwarding the query to a **root
   nameserver**. The root nameserver is at the top of the DNS hierarchy.
1. The root nameserver responds to the upsteam resolver with the IP address of
   the **TLD nameserver** for the root in question, for example `com` or `net`.
   The upstream resolver then forwards the query to the TLD nameserver.
1. The TLD nameserver responds with the IP address of the **authoritative
   nameserver** for the domain in question. This is the nameserver the owner of
   the domain will configure to respond to queries for that domain. It's where
   you typically configure your DNS records.
1. The upstream resolver then forwards the query to the authoritative
   nameserver.
1. Finally, the authoritative nameserver responds with the IP address of the
   host in question, and the upstream resolver returns the final answer to the
   stub resolver on the host that originally made the query.
1. The application on the host can now connect to the IP address returned by the
   stub resolver.

The system of root, TLD, and authoritative nameservers replace the function of
the original `HOSTS.TXT` file maintained by NIC in the ARPANET. However, now
it's distributed -- no one server or organization is responsible for maintaining
the entire database, and the system can scale as more hosts, domains, and IP
addresses are added.

On today's internet, the whole process for resolving a query typically takes a
few hundred milliseconds. Caching resolvers help to speed up the process by
storing the results of queries for a certain amount of time, known as the
record's time-to-live (TTL).

This means that if a host makes the same query multiple times, the stub or
upstream resolver can return the result immediately (assuming the TTL hasn't
expired) without having to query the hierarchy of root, TLD, and authoritative
nameservers again. This can speed up query times by orders of magnitude, to the
point where stub resolvers responding with cached responses are nearly
instantaneous.

So hostnames are now mapped to IP addresses in a scalable way, and queries are
pretty fast on average. DNS worked quite well for the ARPANET! So well, in fact,
that it was adopted mostly unchanged by the internet as it grew to become the
modern network we know it as today.

But hold your champagne bottles. There's just one problem with all these
delightfully distributed domain lookups: security.
