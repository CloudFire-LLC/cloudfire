Firezone comes from humble roots.

When we [launched on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28683231)
nearly two years ago, we never envisioned Firezone to be more than a simple tool
for managing your WireGuard configurations.

WireGuard itself is a work of art but intentionally lacks tooling that would
make it usable in most remote access scenarios... on its own. You have to
generate keys, manage configs, and possibly tie these to user identities if you
wanted to replace existing VPN solutions.

It was an inconvenience myself and engineering friends in my circles had faced.
While we could have spent the time automating most of it away, I decided it'd be
an opportunity to learn some new technologies (Elixir/Phoenix/LiveView), and got
to building.

Fast-forward 4500 GitHub stars, a Y Combinator-fueled funding round, and 130
releases later, Firezone has now grown into something more than just a
self-hosted tool to manage your WireGuard configurations.

We now have over 3,000 Firezone instances running in wild (that we know about)
securing private networks for hobbyists, schools, non-profits, and businesses
with hundreds of employees.

To be clear, Firezone is successful in large part because WireGuard itself is
successful. It's one of those incredible breakthroughs that makes you question
how the world ever got by without it. WireGuard's release made us realize how
bad VPN tooling really was up until that point. As a Cisco employee for 8 years
I should know; AnyConnect was my worst nightmare. What's that? Reconnecting
again due to cipher renegotiation? Fun.

WireGuard in contrast has been a joy to use and build upon. There's no ciphers
to negotiate so tunnel setup and reconnect occurs near instantaneously, even
when roaming. Dropped packets get retransmitted based on the encapsulated
protocol, which is really how things should when you stop to think about it.
WireGuard's great.

But let's take a step back for a moment. Why are VPNs needed? And why are they
used for remote access?

To answer that we need to go all the way back in history to the formation of the
Internet itself.

You see, the early Internet was designed primarily for large entities to connect
to each other. Connecting to the Internet was expensive; only entities with a
business justification and budget could afford the equipment required to connect
to it. Because only large entities could connect, they were inherently trusted.

When you received a packet from an IPv4 address, it was clear which entity it
was from based on its allocated IPv4 address range. If there were any issues
with the received packets, it was clear who to contact.

The early Internet Protocol wasn't designed with authorization in mind.

But, as the Internet grew and access to it became cheaper, more types of
entities could connect. Smaller entities. Untrusted entities. Perhaps even
individuals.

And thus, firewalls were born. Firewalls keep packets out from entities you
don't wish to communicate with. These entities could

But what if you did wish to communicate with some entity? Enter stateful
firewalls (sometimes mistakenly confused with NATs, but that's a whole 'nother
topic I won't get into).

Stateful firewalls only let entities talk to you if (and only if) you've
recently attempted to talk to them first. Recently in most cases means 30
seconds.

access to private networks.

many directions by users with requirements that seemingly contradict one
another. But we wouldn't build a product like this any other way -- we believe
better transparency ultimately leads to better security. That's why we're open
source, after all.

Being open source tends to imply some level of self-hosting, and Firezone has
