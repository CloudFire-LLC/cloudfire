### Conditional access policies

[Policies](/kb/deploy/policies) form the basis of Firezone's access model, and
in June they got a major upgrade with new access modifiers that allow admins to
restrict access to Resources based on Client location, IP address, identity
provider, and time of day.

These are evaluated at the time the access is attempted, and updated in
real-time -- if a Client's location or IP changes, for example, the policy will
be re-evaluated and access will be allowed or denied accordingly.

#### Client location

Use Client location to restrict access to a Resource based on the country where
the Client is attempting to access it from. This is useful for region-locking
certain Resources or preventing Clients in certain countries from accessing
sensitive Resources.

The Client's location is determined by its IP address using
[Google's Regional external Application Load Balancer API](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https).

#### Client IP

  className="rounded shadow"

Another way to restrict access to a Resource is by the Client's IP or CIDR
address.

You can use it as an allowlist, for example, to allow employees to access a
Resource from only a branch office or another VPN.

Or, you can use it as a denylist to block access from malicious IP addresses or
networks you explicitly **don't** want to allow access to your Resources.

#### Identity provider

  alt="Client IP"

  className="rounded shadow"

If you've [configured an identity provider](/kb/authenticate), you can also
require users to have signed into that identity provider in order to access the
Resource in question.

This means you can use Firezone to enforce MFA via your identity provider for
certain extra-sensitive Resources.

And since Firezone supports adding multiple identity providers to your account,
you can configure multiple SSO applications in your identity provider -- each
with their own set of authentication requirements -- for even more flexibility
over access to your Resources.

#### Time of day

### Directory sync support for JumpCloud

<Image

  className="rounded shadow"

In our ongoing effort to make Firezone more accessible to organizations of all
sizes, we've added support for syncing your JumpCloud directory with Firezone.

This integration leverages JumpCloud's SCIM API to push user and group updates
in real-time as they're made in your JumpCloud account. Set up takes only a few
minutes, and once it's done, you can manage access to your Resources in Firezone
using your JumpCloud groups, just like you would with any other identity
provider.

Like other providers, JumpCloud directory sync is available on our Enterprise
plan to ensure we can provide a smooth setup and support experience.

### Blog posts

- [Using Tauri for a cross-platform security app](/blog/using-tauri): Our
  Windows and Linux clients are built using Tauri, a Rust-based framework for
  building cross-platform desktop apps. In this post, we share our experience
  using Tauri and some tips for getting started with it for your own projects.
- [Improving reliability for DNS Resources](/blog/improving-reliability-for-dns-resources):
  We've made some changes to how we handle DNS Resources to make them more
  reliable and resilient to network outages. Read this to learn more about how
  this change may affect your Firezone deployment.
