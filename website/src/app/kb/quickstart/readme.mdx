# Quickstart Guide

Welcome to the Firezone quickstart guide! Use this guide to get up and running
with the some of the most common configuration options.

## Prerequisites

- Firezone account (Don't have an account?
  [Request early access](/product/early-access))
- Resource you want to give users secure access to (e.g. prod server, database,
  SaaS application, subnet, etc...)
- Server or VM (with the ability to deploy a docker container or Linux
  application) that can connect to both the resource, and the internet

## Summary

1. **Sign in to your Firezone Admin Portal** (e.g.
   https://app.firezone.dev/example_company)
1. **Create a Site** - Sites are where admins manage resources, and gateways
   that enable access to those resources (e.g. US-West, Chicago-office).
1. **Deploy a Gateway** - Gateways are Site-specific, and provide connectivity
   between the Firezone client and resources in a Site.
1. **Add a Resource** - A resource is anything you'd like to give users secure
   access to (e.g. a server/VM, database, subnet).
1. **Create a Policy for each Resource** - A policy defines which user-groups
   can access a Resource (note: access is default-deny, which means a user can't
   access a Resource until a Policy permitting access is created).
1. **Download the Firezone Client**

This quickstart guide illustrates a simple Firezone setup. Firezone supports
more complex deployments, but we like to start with the basics. You'll be able
to change everything covered in this guide later, so don't worry if you make a
mistake or two.

Instructions below follow the same order as the summary above. If you follow the
instructions sequentially from top to bottom, you should end up with a working
Firezone network that looks like the architecture diagram at the top of this
guide.

### Signing In

In your browser, visit your unique sign-in URL, which can be found in the
"Welcome to Firezone" email sent after you created your account. Once on the
sign-in page, enter your email and click the sign-in button. You'll receive
another email with a sign in link and token. You may either click the link to be
signed in automatically on the device you're using, or copy the token value and
enter it in to the form on the sign-in page.

### Create a Site

When you log in to the admin portal, you'll land on the Sites page. The first
step will be to create a Site by clicking the 'Add Site' button. We'll
auto-generate a name for the site, but you should consider renaming it something
relevant like `Production`, `US-West`, or `Chicago-office`.

When creating a Site, you're presented with the option to select the routing
policy. Firezone uses industry-standard techniques to automatically holepunch
direct, peer-to-peer connections between clients and gateways. In nearly all
cases, this works fine, but in certain hostile network environments, a Relay
must be used to ensure connectivity. Select `Firezone-managed Relays` to allow
encrypted packets to traverse Firezone's managed global relay network, or select
`Direct only` to force all packets to flow peer-to-peer _only_. Keep in mind
`Direct only` can prevent connections in some rare circumstances based on the
NAT topology of your gateway environment.

After the site is created, you'll be forwarded to the Site Details page where
you can continue the setup process.

### Deploy a Gateway

Gateways run on your infrastructure (server, VM, etc.) and must have access to
the internet as well as the resource you'd like to share via Firezone.

Clicking "Deploy a Gateway" on the Site Details page will give you two options
for deploying a Gateway: `Docker` or `Systemd` (choose whichever method you
prefer, and follow the instruction on that page).

When a Gateway has been successfully deployed, you will be redirected to the
Site Details page where the gateway will now be listed and shown as online.

### Add a Resource

A Resource is anything the site-gateway can reach, that you'd like to give users
access to. Examples include servers, databases, subnets, etc...

On the Site Details page, click on the 'Create a Resource' button. You will now
be able to enter the `name` and `address` for a Resource. The `name` can be
anything you choose, and the `address` must be one of the following:

- IP address
- Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
- CIDR Range

After adding a Resource, you'll need to create a policy authorizing one or more
user-groups to access that resource. End-users cannot access a resource unless
they are members of a group that has explicit access to that resource.

### Create a Policy

Navigate to the Policies page by clicking the 'Policies' button in the left-side
menu bar. Select a Resource, and choose which groups can access that Resource.
Save the policy.

### Install the Firezone Client

When you're finished in the Admin Portal, end-users can connect to available
resources by
[installing the Firezone client for your platform](/kb/deploy/clients), and
signing in.

After installing the client, go to 'Settings' and enter your 'Account ID' (aka
account slug), and apply changes. If you don't recall your Account ID, you can
refer back to the "Welcome to Firezone" email that was sent when you signed up.

To sign in, close the settings window, click "Sign In" in the Firezone app, and
authenticate your account.

You now have secure access to resources shown in the "Resources" section. Enjoy!
