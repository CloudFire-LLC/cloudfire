# Architecture: Security Controls

Firezone employs a few different security controls to keep data secure in
transit and at rest.

## Overview of cryptography used

Below is a table of cryptography used and to which contexts they apply.

| Cryptography                                             | Context         | Notes                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AES-256-GCM                                              | Data at rest    | Used to encrypt sensitive data that needs to be persisted, such as authentication tokens.                                                    |
| TLSv1.2/TLSv1.3                                          | Data in transit | Used to encrypt connections to the admin portal and control plane API.                                                                       |
| ChaCha20, Poly1305, Curve25519, BLAKE2s, SipHash24, HKDF | Data in transit | Used by WireGuardÂ® for VPN tunnels. Read more at https://wireguard.com/protocol. Firezone uses Linux kernel WireGuard without modification. |

## Security policy

We take security issues very seriously and strive to fix all security issues as
soon as they're reported.

### Announcements

We'll announce major security issues on our security mailing list located at:

https://discourse.firez.one/?utm_source=docs.firezone.dev

### Supported versions

We release security patches for supported versions of Firezone. We recommend
running the latest version of Firezone at all times.

See [upgrading](/kb/administer/upgrading) for more on how to keep Firezone up to
date.

### Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security issues you encounter.

Instead, use one of the following methods:

- [Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/security/advisories/new)
  on GitHub. This will be visible to the Firezone security team _but not_ the
  general public.
- Send an email to `security AT firezone.dev` describing the issue and we'll
  respond as soon as possible.

### PGP key

You may use the public key below to encrypt emails to
`security AT firezone.dev`. You can also find this key at:
