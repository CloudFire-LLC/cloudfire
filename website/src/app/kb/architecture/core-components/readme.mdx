# Architecture: Core Components

Firezone consists of a few core components that work together in unison to
deliver secure, reliable access wherever your workforce is located.

These components will be referred to throughout the documentation, so it's
important to understand what each one does and how they interact with each
other.

## Overview

Components in Firezone can be divided into two categories:

1. **Firezone-managed**: Components that we host and operate for you.
1. **User-managed**: Components you host and/or operate yourself.

Each component is described in more detail below.

## Firezone-managed components

These are components we host and operate in our cloud environment.

### Admin portal

`https://app.firezone.dev`

The admin portal is the web-based interface where you configure and manage
Firezone for your organization.

It provides a single pane of glass for configuring authentication, Resources,
Gateways, Policies, and more.

The admin portal is delivered as a managed SaaS application that's load-balanced
globally for high availability.

### Control plane API

`wss://api.firezone.dev`

The control plane API is a WebSocket-based, realtime API that Relays, Gateways,
and Clients connect to for configuration and policy updates. It's responsible
for distributing WireGuard keys to relevant peers and serves as the signaling
layer for Firezone's STUN/TURN implementation.

All configuration updates made in the admin portal are pushed in realtime to
connected Clients and Gateways so they always have up-to-date information about
which Resources are available and which Gateways to use for connecting to them.
This informs our approach to high availability in Firezone: if a Gateway goes
offline, Clients will immediately discontinue using it for new connections.

WebSocket connections are authenticated using a cryptographic token with a
lifetime that varies depending on the type of connection. See the
[authentication docs](/kb/authenticate) for more information regarding token
lifetimes.

The control plane API is delivered as a managed SaaS application that's
load-balanced globally for high availability.

### Policy engine

The policy engine integrates closely with the control plane API to enforce
Policies you've configured in your account. It evaluates each connection request
to determine if it should be allowed or denied based factors such as the Actor's
Group membership, the Resource being accessed, and so on.

If a connection is allowed, the policy engine approves the distribution of
WireGuard keys and STUN signaling information to the requesting Client and an
appropriate Gateway in order to establish a secure connection.

If a connection is is denied, the policy engine drops the connection request,
preventing the Client from learning how to connect to the Gateway or establish a
WireGuard tunnel.

### Relay

Relays help Clients establish direct connections to Gateways using a NAT
traversal technique standardized as
[STUN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8489.html). This works well for the
vast majority of connections.

However, in rare cases, a direct connection cannot be established. This can
happen for a variety of reasons, most commonly one of the following:

- The Client or Gateway is behind a particularly restrictive firewall, sometimes
  referred to as a
  [symmetric NAT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3489#section-5).
  These are more common in enterprise environments, but have become less common
  in recent years.
- The Client or Gateway's network environment is blocking WireGuard traffic.
  This is rare, but can happen on some public WiFi networks and even in some
  countries.

In these cases, the Relay acts as a middleman, implementing the
[TURN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8553) protocol to reliably relay
traffic between the Client and Gateway, **regardless of any network restrictions
standing in the way**.

<Alert color="warning">
  All data plane traffic in Firezone is end-to-end encrypted using WireGuard.
  Relays do not possess the ability to decrypt or otherwise tamper with the data
  being relayed.
</Alert>

Relays are globally distributed across multiple regions to ensure low latency
and reliable connectivity wherever your workforce happens to be.

## Components you manage

These are components you deploy and manage in your environment.

### Clients

The official Firezone Client applications are hosted from the following
locations:

- **macOS / iOS**:
  [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firezone/id6443661826)
- **Android**:
  [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.firezone.android)
- **Windows**:
  [GitHub releases](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)
- **Linux**:
  [GitHub releases](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)

We recommend only using Clients from these official sources to ensure you're
always running an authentic version with the latest security patches.

These can be further distributed using your organization's preferred MDM
solution, if applicable.

### Gateways

Gateways are Linux binaries that run on your infrastructure. They can be
deployed as Docker containers, systemd services, or even as standalone
executables onto a wide variety of Linux configurations.

Gateways were designed to be portable, extremely lightweight, and require no
external dependencies. This makes them easy to deploy and manage at scale.

Gateways operate without the need for persistent storage; instead, they only require a handful of environment variables to be configured for proper functionality. For more information on deploying Gateways, see the
[Gateway deployment guide](/kb/deploy/gateways).

Gateways are hosted from the following locations:

- Binary: [GitHub releases](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)
- Docker: [GitHub Container Registry](ghcr.io/firezone/gateway)

### Resources

Resources are the applications and services you want to secure access to. These
are defined in the admin portal as one of the following:

- A CIDR range, such as `10.0.0.0/24`
- An IP address, such as `172.16.55.1`
- A DNS name with optional wildcard matching, such as `gitlab.company.com` or
  `*.example.com`

Resources can even be public SaaS applications. This can be used to secure
access to public apps such as GitHub, Salesforce, or Slack using DNS names like
`*.github.com`, `*.salesforce.com`, or `*.slack.com`.

### Policies

Policies are the rules that determine who can access which Resources. They're a
simple one-to-one mapping of Group to Resource.

By default, no Policies are created, meaning all access is denied by default and
must be explicitly allowed by creating a Policy. For convenience, Firezone
provides a special `Everyone` Group that can be applied to Policies to allow
access to all authenticated users in your organization.

Policies are evaluated in realtime by the [Policy Engine](#policy-engine) each
time a Client attempts to connect to a Resource.
