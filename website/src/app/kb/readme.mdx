# Docs Overview

Welcome to the Firezone documentation! Here you'll find a collection of helpful
links to get you started.

## What is Firezone?

[Firezone](https://www.firezone.dev) is an open source platform to securely
manage remote access for any-sized organization. Unlike most VPNs, Firezone
takes a granular, least-privileged approach to access management with
group-based policies that control access to individual applications, entire
subnets, and everything in between.
