# Windows Client

Firezone supports Microsoft Windows with a native client for the x86-64
architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or higher
- x86-64 CPU

## Installation

The Windows Client is currently in beta and can be downloaded from the following
links:

- [Download the MSI installer package](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/firezone-windows-client-x64.msi)

## Usage

The Windows Client must be run as an administrator to function correctly.

**Be sure to click "Allow" when prompted by the User Account Control dialog.**

If that dialog does not appear, you may need to manually run Firezone as an
administrator. To do so, right-click the Firezone icon and select "Run as
administrator."
