# Windows Client

The Windows GUI Client is designed for Windows computers where a user is present
to authenticate with your identity provider interactively.

## Prerequisites

- Windows **10** or higher
- **x86-64** CPU
- [**WebView2**](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
  (The installer will install this automatically if needed)

## Installation

Download the `.msi` installer from
[our releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases) or from the
direct link below:

- [Download the Windows `.msi` installer for `x86-64`](/dl/firezone-client-gui-windows/latest/x86_64)

After downloading, run the `.msi` to install the Firezone GUI Client.

To auto-start the Client when you log in, copy the "Firezone" shortcut from your desktop to `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/`

## Usage

### Signing in

1. Run Firezone
1. At the Welcome screen, click `Sign in`. This will open the Firezone sign-in
   page in your default web browser.
1. Sign in using your account slug and identity provider.
1. If your browser asks whether it should open Firezone links, check
   `Always allow` and open the link.
1. When you see the "Firezone connected" notification, the tunnel is ready.

The Welcome screen only appears for your first sign-in. After that, you can use
the tray menu to sign in.

### Accessing a Resource

When Firezone is signed in, web browsers and other programs will automatically
use it to securely connect to Resources.

To copy-paste the address of a Resource you have access to:

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Open a Resource's submenu and click on its address to copy it.

Then you can paste the address into your browser's URL bar and press Enter.

### Signing out

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Sign out`.

when you're signed out, Resources will be inaccessible and your system will use
its normal DNS and Internet behavior.

### Quitting

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Disconnect and Quit` or `Quit`.

The tunnel is now stopped. If you were signed in, the tunnel will restart
automatically next time you open Firezone.

The tunnel is now stopped until you sign in again.

## Upgrading

The Windows Client will automatically check for updates on launch and prompt you
to upgrade when a new version is available. Simply download the latest `.msi`
installer package above, quit the GUI, and install the new MSI over the existing
version.

## Diagnostic logs

Firezone writes log files to disk. These logs stay on your computer and are not
transmitted anywhere. If you encounter a bug, sending us a zip archive of your
logs may help us fix the bug.

To export your logs as a zip archive, or clear your log directory:

1. Right-click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click "Settings".
1. Click "Diagnostic Logs".

## Uninstalling

1. Delete the "Firezone" shortcut from `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/`
1. Quit Firezone.
1. Open the Start Menu. Search for `Add or remove programs` and open it.
1. In the `Add or remove programs` dialog, search for `Firezone`.
1. Click on Firezone and click `Uninstall`.

## Troubleshooting

### Check if Firezone is controlling DNS

In the Start Menu, search for "Windows Powershell". Open it and run this
command:

```pwsh
Get-DnsClientNrptPolicy
```

Firezone Split DNS example:

```text
Namespace                        : .
QueryPolicy                      :
SecureNameQueryFallback          :
DirectAccessIPsecCARestriction   :
DirectAccessProxyName            :
DirectAccessDnsServers           :
DirectAccessEnabled              :
DirectAccessProxyType            : NoProxy
DirectAccessQueryIPsecEncryption :
DirectAccessQueryIPsecRequired   : False
NameServers                      : {100.100.111.1, fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0}
DnsSecIPsecCARestriction         :
DnsSecQueryIPsecEncryption       :
DnsSecQueryIPsecRequired         : False
DnsSecValidationRequired         : False
NameEncoding                     : Utf8WithoutMapping
```

If Firezone's Split DNS is not active, the output will be empty.

### Revert Firezone DNS control

If Firezone crashes and does not revert control of the system's DNS, you can
revert it manually with this command:

```pwsh
Get-DnsClientNrptRule | where Comment -eq firezone-fd0020211111 | foreach { Remove-DnsClientNrptRule -Name $_.Name -Force }
```

1. Right-click on the Start Menu
1. Click "Terminal (Admin)" to open a Powershell terminal with admin privileges
1. When UAC asks "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?"
   click `Yes`
1. Enter the above command and

## Known issues

- Web browsers that use DNS-over-HTTPS by default may not work with Firezone.
  See
  [this guide](/kb/administer/troubleshooting#some-browsers-break-dns-routing)
  to disable DNS-over-HTTPS if you're experiencing issues connecting to DNS
  Resources within your browser.
- Firezone does not register itself with Windows as a VPN
  [#2875](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/2875)
- After clearing diagnostic logs, no more logs are written until the GUI and
  tunnel service each restart.
  [#4764](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/4764)
- In rare cases, Firezone gets stuck signing in
