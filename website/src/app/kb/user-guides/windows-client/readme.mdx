# Windows GUI Client

The Windows GUI Client is designed for Windows computesr where a user is present
to authenticate with your identity provider interactively.

## Prerequisites

- Windows **10** or higher
- **x86_64** CPU

## Installation

The Windows Client can be downloaded from our
[main repository's releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)
or using the direct link below:

- [Download the Windows MSI installer for `x86_64`](/dl/firezone-client-gui-windows/latest/x86_64)

After downloading, run the MSI to install the Firezone GUI Client.

### Signing in

1. Run Firezone
1. At the Welcome screen, click `Sign in`. This will open the Firezone sign-in page in your
default web browser.
1. Sign in using your account slug and identity provider.
1. If your browser asks whether it should open Firezone links, check `Always allow` and open the link.
1. When you see the "Firezone connected" notification, the tunnel is ready.

The Welcome screen only appears for your first sign-in. After that,
you can use the tray menu to sign in.

The web browser will use Firezone to securely connect to the Resource.

### Quitting

The tunnel is now stopped. If you were signed in, the tunnel will restart

The tunnel is now stopped until you sign in again.
