# Windows Client

Firezone supports Microsoft Windows with a native client for the x86-64
architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or higher
- x86-64 CPU

## Installation

The Windows Client is currently in beta and can be downloaded from the following
link:

- [Download the MSI installer package](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/firezone-windows-client-x64.msi)

## Usage

The Windows Client must be run as an administrator to function correctly. **Be
sure to click "Allow" when prompted by the User Account Control dialog.**

If that dialog does not appear, you may need to explicitly run Firezone as an
administrator. To do so, right-click the Firezone icon and select "Run as
administrator."

## Upgrading

The Windows Client will automatically check for updates on launch and prompt you
to upgrade when a new version is available. Simply download the latest MSI
installer package above and install it over the existing version.

## Known issues

Web browsers that enable DNS-over-HTTPS by default may interfere with DNS
resolution. See
[this guide](/kb/administer/troubleshooting#some-browsers-break-dns-routing) to
disable DNS-over-HTTPS if you're experiencing issues connecting to DNS Resources
within your browser.
