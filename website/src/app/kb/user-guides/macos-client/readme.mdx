# macOS Client

Firezone supports macOS with a native client available in the macOS App Store.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 12 or higher
- Intel or Apple silicon Mac

## Installation

[Download the client](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firezone/id6443661826) from
the Apple App Store.

### Upgrading

Updates for the Apple clients are handled through the Apple App Store. Consult
[Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/app-store/update-apps-fir9b01adda3/3.0/mac/14.0)
for more information on how to update apps on your device.

## Known issues

- **DNS Resources**: Web browsers that enable "Secure DNS" or DNS-over-HTTPS by
  default may interfere with DNS resolution because they force all DNS traffic
  through the browser's configured resolvers. See
  [this guide](/kb/administer/troubleshooting#some-browsers-break-dns-routing)
  to disable DNS-over-HTTPS if you're experiencing issues connecting to DNS
  Resources within your browser.
- **Cloudflare WARP client conflicts with other VPN apps**: The Cloudflare WARP
  client may interfere with Firezone's ability to initialize its tunnel
  interface or resolve DNS resources. Ensure the Cloudflare WARP client is
  disabled completely or uninstalled to prevent these issues. See
  [this thread](https://discourse.firez.one/t/firezone-app-on-macos/682) for
  more information.
