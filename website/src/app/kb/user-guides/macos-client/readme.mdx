# macOS Client

Firezone supports macOS with a native client available in the macOS App Store.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

Our macOS client is currently pending final review with Apple. We will update
this page with the App Store link once it is available. In the meantime, use

Test Flight version.

### Upgrading

Updates for the Apple clients are handled through the Apple App Store. Consult

## Known issues

Web browsers that enable DNS-over-HTTPS by default may interfere with DNS
resolution. See
[this guide](/kb/administer/troubleshooting#some-browsers-break-dns-routing) to
disable DNS-over-HTTPS if you're experiencing issues connecting to DNS Resources
within your browser.
