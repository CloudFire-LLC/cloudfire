# Linux GUI Client

The Linux GUI Client is designed for Linux desktop environments where a
user is present to authenticate with your identity provider interactively.

<Alert color="info">
  If you're looking for a headless Client suitable for server or container-based
  installs, see the [Linux headless Client](/kb/user-guides/linux-client) user
  guide instead.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu **20.04** or **22.04**. Other distributions may work, but are not
  officially supported.
- **x86-64** CPU architecture
- **systemd-resolved**. Ubuntu already uses this by default.

## Installation

Download the `.deb` package from our
[releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases),
or from the direct link below:

- [Download the Linux GUI `.deb` for `x86-64`](/dl/firezone-client-gui-linux/latest/x86_64)

Run these commands:

```bash
# Install the package
# The leading `./` is needed so `apt-get` can tell this is a local file
sudo apt-get install ./firezone-client-gui-linux_<VERSION>_<ARCH>.deb

# Add yourself to the `firezone-client` group so you can use the tunnel service
sudo usermod -aG firezone-client "$USER"

# Reboot to finish adding yourself to the group
reboot
```

## Usage

### Signing in

1. Start the GUI by running `firezone-client-gui` from your desktop environment's application
menu or from an interactive shell.
1. At the Welcome screen, click `Sign in`. This will open the Firezone sign-in page in your default web browser.
1. Sign in using your account slug and identity provider
1. On the first run, check `Always allow` to allow your web browser to sign in to Firezone, then click `Open` or `Open link`
1. Unlock your desktop's keyring, or create one if needed.
Most desktops, including GNOME, encrypt the keyring with your login password, so your Firezone
token is encrypted at rest.
1. When you see the `Firezone connected` notification, the tunnel is ready.

The Welcome screen only appears during your first sign-in. After that,
you can click on the Firezone icon in the system tray to open the tray menu and sign in.

### Accessing a Resource

When Firezone is signed in, web browsers and other programs will automatically use it to securely connect to Resources.

To copy-paste the address of a Resource you have access to:

1. Click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Open a Resource's submenu and click on its address to copy it.

### Quitting

When you quit the Firezone GUI, your token is still stored on the disk,
so it will sign in automatically next time you open the GUI.

### Signing out

1. Click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Sign out`.

The tunnel is now stopped until you sign in again.

## Upgrading

1. Quit `firezone-client-gui` if it's running.
1. Install the new package: `sudo apt-get install ./firezone-client-gui-linux_<VERSION>_<ARCH>.deb`
1. Restart `firezone-client-gui`.

## Diagnostic logs

Firezone writes log files to disk. These logs stay on your computer and are not
transmitted anywhere. If you encounter a bug, sending us a zip archive of your logs may help us fix the bug.

To export your logs as a zip archive, or clear your log directory:

1. Click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Settings`.
1. Click `Diagnostic Logs`.

## Uninstalling

1. Quit `firezone-client-gui` if it's running.
1. Remove the package: `sudo apt-get remove firezone-client-gui`

## Troubleshooting

### Check if `systemd-resolved` is enabled

```bash
systemctl status systemd-resolved
stat /etc/resolv.conf
```

`systemctl` should show that `systemd-resolved` is `enabled` and `active (running)`.

`stat` should show that `resolv.conf` is a symlink to `stub-resolv.conf`: `File: /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`

If `systemd-resolved` is not running, or the symlink is not set up, Firezone may
not be able to start, or may not be able to access DNS resources.

### Check if Firezone is controlling DNS

```bash
resolvectl dns
```

Firezone Split DNS:

```
Global:
Link 2 (enp0s6): 10.0.2.3 fec0::3
Link 3 (tun-firezone): 100.100.111.1 fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0
```

Normal system DNS:

```
Global:
Link 2 (enp0s6): 10.0.2.3 fec0::3
```

### Revert Firezone DNS control

The Firezone GUI Client for Linux uses `systemd-resolved` to control DNS, which will
automatically revert DNS to the system defaults when you quit the Firezone GUI, which
destroys the `tun-firezone` virtual network interface.

If the network interface stays up and DNS does not revert, you can try restarting
the tunnel service. Quit the Firezone GUI, then run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart firezone-client-ipc
```

## Known issues

- Web browsers that use DNS-over-HTTPS by default may not work with Firezone. See
[this guide](/kb/administer/troubleshooting#some-browsers-break-dns-routing) to
disable DNS-over-HTTPS if you're experiencing issues connecting to DNS Resources
within your browser.
- After clearing diagnostic logs, no more logs are written until the GUI and tunnel service each restart. [#4764](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/4764)
- The GUI Client does not run on Ubuntu 24.04 yet [#4883](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/4883)
