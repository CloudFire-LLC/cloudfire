# Linux GUI Client

The Linux GUI Client is designed for Linux desktop environments where a user is
present to authenticate with your identity provider interactively.

<Alert color="info">
  If you're looking for a headless Client suitable for server or container-based
  installs, see the [Linux headless Client](/kb/user-guides/linux-client) user
  guide instead.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu **20.04** or **22.04**. Other distributions may work, but are not
  officially supported.
- **x86-64** CPU architecture
- **systemd-resolved**. Ubuntu already uses this by default.

## Installation

Download the `.deb` package from our [changelog page](/changelog), or from the
direct link below:

- [Download the Linux GUI `.deb` for `x86-64`](/dl/firezone-client-gui-linux/latest/x86_64)

Run these commands:

```bash
# Install the package
# The leading `./` is needed so `apt-get` can tell this is a local file
sudo apt-get install ./firezone-client-gui-linux_<VERSION>_<ARCH>.deb

# Add yourself to the `firezone-client` group so you can use the tunnel service
sudo usermod -aG firezone-client "$USER"

# Reboot to finish adding yourself to the group
reboot
```

To auto-start the Client when you log in, run
`firezone-client-gui debug set-autostart true`

## Usage

### Signing in

1. Start the GUI by running `firezone-client-gui` from your desktop
   environment's application menu or from an interactive shell.
1. At the Welcome screen, click `Sign in`. This will open the Firezone sign-in
   page in your default web browser.
1. Sign in using your account slug and identity provider
1. On the first run, check `Always allow` to allow your web browser to sign in
   to Firezone, then click `Open` or `Open link`
1. Unlock your desktop's keyring, or create one if needed. Most desktops,
   including GNOME, encrypt the keyring with your login password, so your
   Firezone token is encrypted at rest.
1. When you see the `Firezone connected` notification, Firezone is running.

The Welcome screen only appears during your first sign-in. After that, you can
click on the Firezone icon in the system tray to open the tray menu and sign in.

### Accessing a Resource

When Firezone is signed in, web browsers and other programs will automatically
use it to securely connect to Resources.

To copy-paste the address of a Resource:

1. Click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Open a Resource's submenu and click on its address to copy it.
1. Paste the address into your browser's URL bar and press Enter.

### Quitting

1. Click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Disconnect and Quit` or `Quit`.

When Firezone is not running, you can't access private Resources, and the
computer will use its normal DNS and Internet behavior.

If you were signed in, then you will still be signed in the next time you start
Firezone.

### Signing out

1. Click on the Firezone tray icon to open the menu.
1. Click `Sign out`.

When you're signed out, you can't access private Resources, and the computer
will use its normal DNS and Internet behavior.

## Upgrading

1. Download the latest `.deb` installer package from
   ["Installation"](#installation) above.
1. Quit `firezone-client-gui` if it's running.
1. Install the new package:
   `sudo apt-get install ./firezone-client-gui-linux_<VERSION>_<ARCH>.deb`
1. Restart `firezone-client-gui`.

## Diagnostic logs

Firezone writes log files to disk. These logs stay on your computer and are not
transmitted anywhere. If you find a bug, you can send us a `.zip` archive of
your logs to help us fix the bug.

To export or clear your logs:

1. Click on the Firezone tray icon.
1. Click `Settings`.
1. Click `Diagnostic Logs`.
1. Click `Export Logs` or `Clear Log Directory`.

## Uninstalling

1. Remove the auto-start link: `firezone-client-gui debug set-autostart false`
1. Quit `firezone-client-gui` if it's running.
1. Remove the package: `sudo apt-get remove firezone-client-gui`

## Troubleshooting

### Check if `systemd-resolved` is enabled

```bash
systemctl status systemd-resolved
stat /etc/resolv.conf
```

`systemctl` should show that `systemd-resolved` is `enabled` and
`active (running)`.

`stat` should show that `resolv.conf` is a symlink to `stub-resolv.conf`:
`File: /etc/resolv.conf -> ../run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`

If `systemd-resolved` is not running, or the symlink is not set up, Firezone may
not be able to start, or may not be able to access DNS resources.

### Check if Firezone is controlling DNS

```bash
resolvectl dns
```

Firezone Split DNS:

```text
Global:
Link 2 (enp0s6): 10.0.2.3 fec0::3
Link 3 (tun-firezone): 100.100.111.1 fd00:2021:1111:8000:100:100:111:0
```

Normal system DNS:

```text
Global:
Link 2 (enp0s6): 10.0.2.3 fec0::3
```

### Revert Firezone DNS control

The Firezone GUI Client for Linux uses `systemd-resolved` to control DNS, which
will automatically revert DNS to the system defaults when you quit the Firezone
GUI, which destroys the `tun-firezone` virtual network interface.

If the network interface stays up and DNS does not revert, you can try
restarting the tunnel service. Quit the Firezone GUI, then run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart firezone-client-ipc
```

## Known issues

- **DNS Resources**: Web browsers that enable "Secure DNS" or DNS-over-HTTPS by
  default may interfere with DNS resolution because they force all DNS traffic
  through the browser's configured resolvers. See
  [Administer / Troubleshooting / Some browsers break DNS routing](/kb/administer/troubleshooting#some-browsers-break-dns-routing)
  to disable DNS-over-HTTPS if you're experiencing issues connecting to DNS
  Resources within your browser.
- After clearing diagnostic logs, no more logs are written until the GUI and
  tunnel service each restart.
