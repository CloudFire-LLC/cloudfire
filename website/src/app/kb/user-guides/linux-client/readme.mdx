# Linux Client

Firezone supports Linux with a native client for ARM v7, ARM64, and Intel x64
architectures.

The Linux Client is a lightweight, standalone binary that runs in the background
using a service account token.

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux-based OS with kernel 3.10 or higher
- ARM64, ARMv7, or Intel x64 CPU
- Administrator access to your Firezone account in order to create a Service
  Account and generate a token

## Installation

The Linux Client is currently in beta and can be downloaded from our
[main repository's releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
Alternatively, download the latest Client binary using one of the links below:

- [Download the Linux Client for `x86_64`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-x64)

- [Download the Linux Client for `arm64`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-arm64)

## Running the Linux Client

The Linux Client requires a Service Account token to authenticate to Firezone.
If you don't already have a token generated, follow the instructions in the
[Service Account](kb/authenticate/service-accounts) documentation.

Once you have a token, you can start the Linux Client using the following
command:

```bash
sudo ./linux-client-x64 <TOKEN>
```

A sample output of the help command is shown below:

```text
