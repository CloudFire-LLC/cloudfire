# Linux Client

Firezone supports Linux with a native, headless client for ARMv7l, ARM64, and
x86-64 architectures.

The Linux Client is a lightweight, standalone binary that runs in the background
using a service account token.

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux-based OS with kernel 3.10 or higher
- ARM64, ARMv7l, or x86-64 CPU
- Administrator access to your Firezone account in order to create a Service
  Account and generate a token

## Installation

The Linux Client is currently in beta and can be downloaded from our
[main repository's releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
Alternatively, download the latest Client binary using one of the links below:

- [Download the Linux Client for `x86-64`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-x64)
- [Download the Linux Client for `ARMv7l`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-arm)
- [Download the Linux Client for `ARM64`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-arm64)

## Usage

The Linux Client requires a Service Account token to authenticate to Firezone.
If you don't already have a token generated, follow the instructions in the
[Service Account](/kb/authenticate/service-accounts) documentation.

Once you have a token, you can start the Linux Client using the following
command:

```
sudo FIREZONE_TOKEN=<TOKEN> ./linux-client-x64
```

Set some environment variables to configure it:

```
export FIREZONE_NAME="Development Webserver"
export FIREZONE_ID="some unique identifier"
export FIREZONE_TOKEN=<TOKEN>
export DNS_CONTROL="systemd-resolved" # or "etc-resolv-conf"
export LOG_DIR="./"
sudo -E ./linux-client-x64
```

See [below](#environment-variable-reference) for a full list of environment
variables.

A sample output of the help command is shown below:

```
> sudo ./linux-client-x64 -h

Usage: linux-client-x64 [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

Commands:
  standalone  Act as a CLI-only Client
  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
      --token-path <TOKEN_PATH>
          A filesystem path where the token can be found [env: FIREZONE_TOKEN_PATH=] [default: /etc/dev.firezone.client/token.txt]
  -i, --firezone-id <FIREZONE_ID>
          Identifier used by the portal to identify and display the device [env: FIREZONE_ID=]
  -l, --log-dir <LOG_DIR>
          File logging directory. Should be a path that's writeable by the current user [env: LOG_DIR=]
  -m, --max-partition-time <MAX_PARTITION_TIME>
          Maximum length of time to retry connecting to the portal if we're having internet issues or it's down. Accepts human times. e.g. "5m" or "1h" or "30d" [env: MAX_PARTITION_TIME=]
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```

### Split DNS

By default, Split DNS is **disabled** for the Linux Client. This means that
access to DNS-based Resources won't be routed through Firezone.

To enable Split DNS for the Linux Client, set the `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL`
environment variable to `systemd-resolved` or `etc-resolv-conf`.

Read more below to figure out which DNS control method is appropriate for your
system.

#### systemd-resolved

On most modern Linux distributions, DNS resolution is handled by
`systemd-resolved`. If this is the case for you, set `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to
`systemd-resolved`. If you're not sure, you can check by running the following
command:

```
systemctl status systemd-resolved
```

#### NetworkManager

In most cases, if you're using NetworkManager your system is likely already
using `systemd-resolved`, and you should set `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to
`systemd-resolved`. You'll need to ensure that `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink
to `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`:

```
# Check if /etc/resolv.conf is already a symlink to /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
stat /etc/resolv.conf

# If it's not, create the symlink
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

When NetworkManager detects that symlink exists, it will automatically use
`systemd-resolved` for DNS resolution and no other configuration is necessary.

#### /etc/resolv.conf

If you're not using `systemd-resolved`, Firezone supports using the
`/etc/resolv.conf` file to configure Split DNS as a fallback. To do this, set
`FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to `etc-resolv-conf`, and the Linux Client will override
the `/etc/resolv.conf` file with the Firezone internal proxy.

When the Linux Client process exits, it will revert the `/etc/resolv.conf` file
back to its original state. If for some reason this isn't the case, you can
easily restore it by running the following command:

```
sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf.before-firezone /etc/resolv.conf
```

### Environment variable reference

Here's an exhaustive list of environment variables you can use for the Linux
client.

| Variable Name          | Default Value       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FIREZONE_TOKEN`       |                     | Service account token generated by the portal to authenticate this Client.                                                                                                                              |
| `FIREZONE_NAME`        | `<system hostname>` | Friendly name for this client to display in the UI.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `FIREZONE_ID`          |                     | Identifier used by the portal to identify this client for metadata and display purposes.                                                                                                                |
| `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` |                     | The DNS control method to use. Set to `systemd-resolved` to use systemd-resolved for Split DNS, or `etc-resolv-conf` to use the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. If left blank, Split DNS will be **disabled**. |
| `LOG_DIR`              |                     | File logging directory. Should be a path that's writeable by the current user. If unset, logs will be written to STDOUT only.                                                                           |
| `RUST_LOG`             | `error`             | Log level for the client. Set to `debug` for verbose logging. Read more about configuring Rust log levels [here](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/).                                        |
