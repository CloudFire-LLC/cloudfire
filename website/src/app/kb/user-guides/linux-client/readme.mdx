# Linux Client

Firezone supports Linux with a native, headless client for ARM v7, ARM64, and
Intel x64 architectures.

The Linux Client is a lightweight, standalone binary that runs in the background
using a service account token.

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux-based OS with kernel 3.10 or higher
- ARM64, ARMv7, or Intel x64 CPU
- Administrator access to your Firezone account in order to create a Service
  Account and generate a token

## Installation

The Linux Client is currently in beta and can be downloaded from our
[main repository's releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
Alternatively, download the latest Client binary using one of the links below:

- [Download the Linux Client for `x86_64`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-x64)
- [Download the Linux Client for `armv7l`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-arm)
- [Download the Linux Client for `arm64`](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases/latest/download/linux-client-arm64)

## Running the Linux Client

The Linux Client requires a Service Account token to authenticate to Firezone.
If you don't already have a token generated, follow the instructions in the
[Service Account](kb/authenticate/service-accounts) documentation.

Once you have a token, you can start the Linux Client using the following
command:

```bash
sudo ./linux-client-x64 <TOKEN>
```

Set some environment variables to configure it:

```bash
FIREZONE_NAME="Development Webserver"
FIREZONE_ID="some unique identifier"
DNS_CONTROL="systemd-resolved" # or "etc-resolv-conf"
LOG_DIR="./"
sudo -E ./linux-client-x64 <TOKEN>
```

See [below](#environment-variable-reference) for a full list of environment
variables.

A sample output of the help command is shown below:

```text
> sudo ./linux-client-x64 -h

Usage: linux-client-x64 [OPTIONS] --firezone-id <FIREZONE_ID> <TOKEN> [MAX_PARTITION_TIME]

Arguments:
  <TOKEN>               Token generated by the portal to authorize websocket connection [env: FIREZONE_TOKEN=]
  [MAX_PARTITION_TIME]  Maximum length of time to retry connecting to the portal if we're having internet issues or it's down [env: MAX_PARTITION_TIME=] [default: 30d]

Options:
  -n, --firezone-name <FIREZONE_NAME>  Friendly name to display in the UI [env: FIREZONE_NAME=]
  -i, --firezone-id <FIREZONE_ID>      Identifier generated by the portal to identify and display the device [env: FIREZONE_ID=]
  -l, --log-dir <LOG_DIR>              File logging directory. Should be a path that's writeable by the current user [env: LOG_DIR=]
  -h, --help                           Print help
  -V, --version                        Print version
```

### Split DNS

The Linux Client supports Split DNS, which you can enable by setting the
`FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` environment variable to `systemd-resolved` or
`etc-resolv-conf`. If you don't set this variable, Split DNS will be disabled.

When Split DNS is enabled, the Linux Client will override the system's DNS
resolver with its internal proxy. To do this, the Linux client needs to know how
DNS resolution is currently being handled on your system.

#### systemd-resolved

On most modern Linux distributions, DNS resolution is handled by
`systemd-resolved`. If this is the case for you, set `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to
`systemd-resolved`. If you're not sure, you can check by running the following
command:

```bash
systemctl status systemd-resolved
```

#### NetworkManager

In most cases, if you're using NetworkManager your system is likely already
using `systemd-resolved`, and you should set `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to
`systemd-resolved`. You'll need to ensure that `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink
to `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf`:

```bash
stat /etc/resolv.conf
sudo ln -sf /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

When NetworkManager detects that symlink exists, it will automatically use
`systemd-resolved` for DNS resolution.

#### `/etc/resolv.conf`

If you're not using `systemd-resolved`, Firezone supports using the
`/etc/resolv.conf` file to configure Split DNS as a fallback. To do this, set
`FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` to `etc-resolv-conf`, and the Linux Client will override
the `/etc/resolv.conf` file with the Firezone internal proxy.

### Environment variable reference

Here's an exhaustive list of environment variables you can use for the Linux
client.

| Variable Name          | Default Value       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `FIREZONE_ID`          | `<random uuidv4>`   | Identifier used by the portal to identify this client for metadata and display purposes.                                                                                                                     |
| `FIREZONE_DNS_CONTROL` |                     | The DNS control method to use. Set to `systemd-resolved` to use systemd-resolved for DNS resolution, or `etc-resolv-conf` to use the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. If left blank, Split DNS will be **disabled**. |
| `LOG_DIR`              |                     | File logging directory. Should be a path that's writeable by the current user. If unset, logs will be written to STDOUT only.                                                                                |
| `RUST_LOG`             | `error`             | Log level for the client. Set to `debug` for verbose logging. Read more about configuring Rust log levels [here](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/).                                             |
