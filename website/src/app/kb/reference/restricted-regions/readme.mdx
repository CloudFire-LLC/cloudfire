# Restricted regions

Firezone is a global service, but there are some regions where we can't provide
service due to legal restrictions imposed by United States sanctions laws. These
regions are:

- Russia
- Belarus
- The Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions of Ukraine
- Iran
- North Korea
- Syria
- Cuba
- Venezuela
- Sudan
- Burma (Myanmar)

Connections to the Firezone service from IP addresses in these regions will be
blocked by our network infrastructure with a `403 Forbidden` response. This
happens on a per-connection basis; access to the Firezone service will resume
when you connect from a non-restricted region.

Your Firezone account **will not** be blocked on a regional basis as long as
your billing information has never been associated with a restricted region. If
it has and you need to update your billing information, please
[contact support](/support).

For more information on these restrictions, please see the
[Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information)
website.
