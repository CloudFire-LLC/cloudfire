# Directory sync

</PlanBadge>

Firezone supports automatic directory sync from Google Workspace, Microsoft
Entra ID, and Okta. This feature is **automatically enabled** when you create
one of the [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google),
[Microsoft Entra](/kb/authenticate/entra), or [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta)
connectors. No further configuration is necessary. Once the connector is
activated, users, groups, and organizational units will be synced from your
identity provider every few minutes.

## How Firezone treats deleted entities

Firezone **never** deletes entities synced from your identity provider. This
helps to preserve audit trails and other logged activity within Firezone.

### Deleting or suspending a user

When a user is deleted or suspended in your identity provider, Firezone will
disable the user and clear all active client and admin portal web sessions for
that user upon the next sync. The user will be **signed out of all clients** and
forced to reauthenticate.

This ensures terminated employees will have all Firezone access revoked within a
few minutes of deleting or suspending them in your identity provider.

### Deleting a group or organizational unit

When a group or organizational unit is deleted in your identity provider,
Firezone will hide the group and delete any associated policies.

## Nested groups and organizational units

Firezone syncs transitive memberships from your identity provider. This means
user membership for a particular group is determined not only by its immediate
members, but any child groups as well. This allows you to create nested group
structures in your identity provider and have their memberships automatically
reflected in Firezone.

For example, if you had the following group structure in your identity provider:

```yaml
Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  Support:
    - patrick@company.com
  Engineering:
    - bob@company.com
    - alice@company.com
    Devops:
      - john@company.com
```

You would see the following group memberships in Firezone:

```yaml
Group:Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  - patrick@company.com
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Engineering:
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Support:
  - patrick@company.com
Group:DevOps:
  - john@company.com
```
