# Authentication

Firezone supports the following authentication methods and identity providers:

1. [Email (OTP)](/kb/authenticate/email): Supports authenticating with a
   one-time passcode sent via email.
1. [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/kb/authenticate/oidc): Supports authenticating to an
   OpenID Connect provider using a universal OIDC connector.
1. [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google): Supports authentication and user
   / group sync with Google Workspace.
1. [Microsoft Entra](/kb/authenticate/entra): Supports authentication and user /
   group sync with Microsoft Entra.
1. [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta): Supports authentication and user / group sync
   with Microsoft Entra.

It's possible to create multiple providers for Google Workspace, Microsoft
Entra, and OIDC connectors. This allows you to authenticate users against
multiple providers simultaneously

<Alert color="warning">
  Disabling the email provider can lock you out of your account in the event
  that all other identity providers become unusable. We recommend keeping at
  least one admin enabled for the email provider for account recovery.

## Session lifetime

The table below summarizes the session lifetimes for various components.

| Component           | Auth Provider                     | Lifetime                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin portal web UI | Email authentication              | **10 hours**                                                                |
| Admin portal web UI | OIDC and other identity providers | Copied from the OIDC access token lifetime, up to a maximum of **10 hours** |
| Client applications | All identity providers            | **10 hours**                                                                |
| Service accounts    | N/A                               | **365 days** by default, configurable per token                             |
| Gateways            | N/A                               | **Indefinitely**. Tokens must be explicitly revoked in the portal UI.       |

When a session token expires or is revoked, the affected component is
disconnected immediately and must reauthenticate to regain access to resources.
This includes web UI sessions for admins.
