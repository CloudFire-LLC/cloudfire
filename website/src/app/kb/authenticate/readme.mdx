# Authentication

Firezone supports the following authentication methods and identity providers:

1. [Email (OTP)](/kb/authenticate/email): Authenticate with a one-time passcode
   sent to a user's email.
1. [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/kb/authenticate/oidc): Authenticate to any OpenID
   Connect provider using a universal OIDC connector.
1. [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google): Authenticate users and sync
   users and groups with Google Workspace.
1. [Microsoft Entra ID](/kb/authenticate/entra): Authenticate users and sync
   users and groups with Microsoft Entra ID.
1. [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta): Authenticate users and sync users and groups
   with Okta.

It's possible to create multiple providers for Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra
ID, Okta, and OIDC connectors. This allows you to authenticate users against
multiple providers simultaneously, each with different groups and permissions.

<Alert color="warning">
  Disabling the email provider can lock you out of your account in the event
  that all other identity providers become unusable. We recommend keeping at
  least one admin enabled for the email provider for account recovery.

## Session lifetime

The table below summarizes the session lifetimes for various components.

| Component           | Auth Provider                     | Lifetime                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin portal web UI | Email authentication              | **10 hours**                                                                |
| Admin portal web UI | OIDC and other identity providers | Copied from the OIDC access token lifetime, up to a maximum of **10 hours** |
| Client applications | All identity providers            | **10 hours**                                                                |
| Service accounts    | N/A                               | **365 days** by default, configurable per token                             |
| Gateways            | N/A                               | **Indefinitely**. Tokens must be explicitly revoked in the portal UI.       |

When a session token expires or is revoked, the affected component is
disconnected immediately and must reauthenticate to regain access to resources.
This includes web UI sessions for admins.
