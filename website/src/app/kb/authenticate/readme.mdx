# Authentication

Firezone supports the following authentication methods:

1. [Email (OTP)](/kb/authenticate/email)
1. [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/kb/authenticate/oidc)
1. [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google)

## Session lifetime

The below session lifetimes apply to all identity providers:

- Admin portal:
  - Email providers: **10 hours**
  - OIDC and other providers: Same as the OIDC application's access token
    lifetime up to a maximum of **10 hours**.
- Client application: **7 days**
- Service account: **365 days** (by default, configurable per token)

When a client application or service account token expires, the client is
disconnected immediately and must reauthenticate to regain access to resources.

When the admin portal session expires, the admin is logged out immediately and
must reauthenticate to regain access to the portal.
