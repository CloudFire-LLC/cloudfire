# SSO with OpenID Connect

</PlanBadge>

Firezone supports authenticating users with a universal OIDC connector that
works with any authentication service offering a standard
[OIDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) authentication mechanism. Use this
connector to enable authenticating users and admins to Firezone for any
OIDC-capable identity provider that supports the `authorization_code` grant.

This connector works great for popular hosted providers like Google Workspace,
Microsoft Entra ID, and Okta, and for self-hosted providers like
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org) and [Ory](https://www.ory.sh).

<Alert color="warning">
  Directory sync is **not supported** with the universal OIDC connector. See the
  [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google), [Microsoft Entra
  ID](/kb/authenticate/entra), or [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta) connectors for
  automatic directory sync. You'll need to manually create and manage users and
  groups for use with the universal OIDC connector.
</Alert>

For Firezone-specific instructions for a given provider, select your provider in
the list below:

- [Auth0](/kb/authenticate/oidc/auth0)
- [Fusion Auth](/kb/authenticate/oidc/fusion)

For others, consult your provider's documentation for setting up an OpenID
Connect client. Here's a list of popular providers with links to their OIDC
documentation for convenience:

- [Google Workspace](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
- [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols-oidc)
- [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/)

## Setting up the universal OIDC connector

To set up the universal OIDC connector, go to
`Settings -> Identity Providers -> Add Identity Provider` and select
`OpenID Connect` as the identity provider.

In general, you'll need three pieces of information to set up the connector:

- [Scopes](#scopes): These control what information Firezone can access from
  your identity provider. At a minimum, you'll need to provide the `openid`,
  `profile`, and `email` scopes. These are configured in your identity
  provider's OAuth app settings.
- [Redirect URIs](#redirect-uris): These are unique to each provider in your
  Firezone account and are used to complete the authentication process. These
  are configured in your identity provider's OAuth app settings.
- [Client ID and secret](#client-id-and-secret): These are used to authenticate
  Firezone with your identity provider. These are configured in Firezone.
- [Discovery document URI](#discovery-document-uri): This is the URL to your
  identity provider's OIDC discovery document. This is used to automatically
  configure the connector with your identity provider's settings and is
  configured in Firezone.

### Scopes

Firezone requires the following scopes to be added on the connector at a
minimum:

- `openid`: Required by all OpenID Connect integrations and used to identity
  this user in Firezone
- `profile`: Required for providing the user's name
- `email`: Required for authentication

### Redirect URIs

When setting up the connector, you'll need to provide two redirect URIs in the
connector's allowlist. These are shown in the setup form and are unique to each
provider in your Firezone account. They allow Firezone to receive authentication
tokens from your identity provider to complete the authentication process.

### Client ID and secret

You'll also need to provide the client ID and secret from your identity provider
when setting up the connector. These are used to authenticate Firezone with your
identity provider.

### Discovery document URI

The discovery document URI is the URL to your identity provider's OIDC discovery
document. This document contains all the information needed to configure the
connector with your identity provider's settings. You can usually find this URL
in your identity provider's OAuth app settings or in their OIDC documentation.

It typically looks something like this (Okta example given):

```text
https://your-tenant.okta.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

### PKCE

If the option is available, be sure to **enable PKCE** for the connector. This
is a security feature that helps prevent certain types of attacks and is
recommended for added security.

For more detailed guides specific to each provider, see the
[Firezone legacy documentation](/docs/authenticate/oidc). Firezone 1.0 uses the
same OIDC connector under the hood as our legacy version, so the steps should
similar.
