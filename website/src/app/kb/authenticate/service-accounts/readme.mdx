# Service Accounts

<PlanBadge plans={["starter", "enterprise"]} />

Service accounts are actors that can be used with the Firezone Linux client in
headless operation to manage access from a server, machine, or other non-user
machine to your Resources.

Service accounts behave like any other actor in Firezone. They can be added to
Groups and Policies to gain access to Resources.

Unlike users, however, service accounts must be managed manually and are never
synced from your identity provider.

    Because service accounts authenticate to your Firezone account
    without user interaction, their tokens have a <strong>1-year</strong>
    expiration by default.
  `}
/>

## Create a service account

To create a service account, head to `Actors` -> `Add Actor` and select
`Service Account` as the type.

On the next screen, set an appropriate expiration date for the token.

You will then be shown a token you'll need to store somewhere safe to use with
the [Linux client](/kb/user-guides/linux-client).
