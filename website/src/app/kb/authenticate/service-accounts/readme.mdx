# Service Accounts

Service accounts are actors that can be used with the Firezone Linux client in
headless operation to manage access from a server, machine, or other non-user
machine to your Resources.

Service accounts behave like any other actor in Firezone. They can be added to
Groups and Policies to gain access to Resources.

    Because service accounts authenticate to your Firezone account
    without user interaction, <strong>their tokens don't expire</strong>.
    We recommend manually rotating service account tokens on a scheduled
    interval as a best practice.

## Create a service account

To create a service account, head to `Actors` -> `Add Actor` and select
`Service Account` as the type.

You will then be shown a token you'll need to copy somewhere safe to use with
the [Linux client](/kb/user-guides/linux-client).
