# User / Group sync

</PlanBadge>

Firezone supports automatic user / group sync from Google Workspace, Microsoft
Entra ID, and Okta. This feature is **automatically enabled** when you create
one of the [Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google),
[Microsoft Entra](/kb/authenticate/entra), or [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta)
connectors. No further configuration is necessary. Once the connector is
activated, users, groups, and organizational units will be synced from your
identity provider every few minutes.

## Deleting or suspending users

Firezone <strong>never</strong> deletes synced users or groups. Instead, they're
disabled temporarily in Firezone when they're deleted or suspended in your
identity provider. This helps to preserve audit trails and other logged activity
within Firezone.

When a user is deleted or suspended in your identity provider, Firezone will
disable the user and clear all active client and admin portal web sessions for
that user upon the next sync. The user will be **signed out of all clients** and
forced to reauthenticate.

This ensures terminated employees will have all Firezone access revoked within a
few minutes of deleting or suspending them in your identity provider.

### Deleting a group or organizational unit

Deleting a group or organizational unit in your identity provider will hide the
group and delete the associated policy in Firezone.

## Nested groups and organizational units

Firezone syncs transitive memberships from your identity provider. This means
user membership for a particular group is determined not only by its immediate
members, but any child groups as well. This allows you to create nested group
structures in your identity provider and have their memberships automatically
reflected in Firezone.

For example, if you had the following group structure in your identity provider:

```yaml
Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  Support:
    - patrick@company.com
  Engineering:
    - bob@company.com
    - alice@company.com
    Devops:
      - john@company.com
```

You would see the following group memberships in Firezone:

```yaml
Group:Everyone:
  - steve@company.com
  - patrick@company.com
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Engineering:
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - john@company.com
Group:Support:
  - patrick@company.com
Group:DevOps:
  - john@company.com
```
