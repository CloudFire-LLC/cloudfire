Firezone supports automatic user / group sync from Google Workspace and
Microsoft Entra. This feature is **automatically enabled** for the
[Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google) and
[Microsoft Entra](/kb/authenticate/entra) connectors. No further configuration
is necessary. Once the connector is activated, users, groups, and organizational
units will be synced from your identity provider every few minutes.

## Deleting or suspending users

Firezone <strong>never</strong> deletes synced users or groups. Instead, they're
disabled temporarily in Firezone when they're deleted or suspended in your
identity provider. This helps to preserve audit trails and other logged activity
within Firezone.

When a user is deleted or suspended in a supported identity provider, Firezone
will disable the user and clear all active client and admin portal web sessions
for that user upon the next sync. The user will be **signed out of all clients**
and forced to reauthenticate.

This ensures terminated employees will have all Firezone access revoked within a
few minutes of deleting or suspending them in your identity provider.

### Deleting a group or organizational unit

Deleting a group or organizational unit in your identity provider will hide the
group and associated policy in Firezone.

## Nested groups and organizational units

Firezone syncs transitive memberships from your identity provider. This means
user membership for a particular group is determined not only by its immediate
members, but any child groups as well, recursively.

For example, if you had the following group structure in your identity provider:

```
- Everyone
  - steve@company.com
  - Engineering
    - bob@company.com
    - alice@company.com
    - Devops
      - john@company.com
  - Support
    - patrick@company.com
```

In Firezone, you would see the follow groups after sync:

```
- Group:Everyone
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
  - steve@company.com
  - john@company.com
- Group:Engineering
  - bob@company.com
  - alice@company.com
- Group:Support
  - patrick@company.com
- Group:DevOps
  - john@firezone.dev
```
