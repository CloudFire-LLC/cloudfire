# Email authentication

<PlanBadge plans={["starter", "enterprise"]} />

Firezone supports email authentication using a one-time password (OTP).

This connector is enabled by default for all plans and is designed to get you up
and running with Firezone quickly. For production deployments, we recommend
setting up [Universal OIDC](/kb/authenticate/oidc),
[Google Workspace](/kb/authenticate/google),
[Microsoft Entra ID](/kb/authenticate/entra), or [Okta](/kb/authenticate/okta)
authentication.

Firezone's OTP-based email authentication connector sends a one-time password to
the user's email each time authentication is requested. This password is
short-lived and can only be used to authenticate once.

  Users authenticated via the email connector will need to be added and removed
  from groups manually.

## Disabling email authentication

The email authentication connector can be **disabled completely** for your
account, forcing all users and admins to authenticate with another connector.
However, this can lead to issues signing in if one of your other authentication
connectors stops working. For that reason, you may want to leave the email
authentication connector enabled with at least one admin for recovery purposes.
