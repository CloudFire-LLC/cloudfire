Check that the container is running:

```bash
docker ps --filter "name=firezone-gateway"
```

Check the container logs:

```bash
docker logs firezone-gateway
```

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="Systemd">

Check the status of the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status firezone-gateway
```

Check the logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u firezone-gateway.service
```

## Some browsers break DNS routing

Some web browsers enable DNS-over-HTTPS by default, which can interfere with
Firezone's DNS-based routing system. If you're experiencing issues connecting to
DNS Resources in your browser, or notice that DNS resources aren't being routed
through a Firezone Gateway when they should be, try disabling DNS-over-HTTPS
using the appropriate method below.

### Firefox

1. Go to `about:preferences#privacy` in the address bar.
1. Scroll down to the "DNS over HTTPS" section.
1. Ensure that "Off" is selected.

### Chrome

1. Go to `chrome://settings/security` in the address bar.
1. Scroll down to the "Advanced" section.
1. Ensure that "Use secure DNS" is disabled.
