# Backup and Restore

In Firezone 1.x and above, all configuration is kept in the Admin portal and
therefore no backup and restore procedures are necessary. WireGuard keys are
generated ephemerally each time a Client or Gateway starts and don't need to be
(nor should they be) saved.

That said, you may want to make sure to save the following configuration
parameters in cases where you're replacing gateway VMs or headless clients tied
to service accounts:

- The `FIREZONE_TOKEN` environment variable authenticates gateways and clients
  to the portal and determines which configurations to load respectively. This
  is a secret that should **always** be saved in a safe place.
- The `FIREZONE_ID` environment variable identifies gateways and clients to the
  portal for metadata tracking. We recommend saving this if you'd like to
  maintain consistency for display in the portal.
