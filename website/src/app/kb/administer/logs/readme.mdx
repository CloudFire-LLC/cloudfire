# Viewing Logs

Firezone maintains log files in various locations depending on the component and
operating system. Logs are scrubbed for sensitive and personally-identifiable
information before being written to disk.

Below is a table listing the various log directories used by each component.

| Component      | Log directory                                                                           |
