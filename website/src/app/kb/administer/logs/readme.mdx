# Viewing logs

Firezone maintains diagnostic log files in various locations depending on the
component and operating system. Logs are scrubbed for sensitive and
personally-identifiable information before being written to disk.

Diagnostic logs are used primarily by the Firezone team for troubleshooting
connectivity and other issues, but they may also be useful for dianosing issues
by advanced users and admins.
