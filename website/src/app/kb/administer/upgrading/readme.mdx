# Upgrading Firezone

Upgrading Firezone consists of upgrading the client applications and gateways.
Read more below to understand how our versioning system works, how you can
auto-update these components, and suggestions for an upgrade strategy in
high-availability deployments.

## How versioning works in Firezone

Firezone uses a simple versioning scheme with the following structure:

`MARKETING`.`API_DATE`.`PATCH`

Each of these fields is described below.

| Version field | Example    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MARKETING`   | `1`        | Marketing version. Updates to this version generally constitute a new architecture or product. Updated every few years on average.                                                                               |
| `API_DATE`    | `20231001` | API version. Clients and gateways **must** be the same API version to function together. The Firezone admin portal supports the latest **two** API versions at the same time. Updated every 6 months on average. |
| `PATCH`       | `11`       | Patch version. Represents backwards-compatible bug fixes and updates that are generally recommended for all users. Updated on average every week.                                                                |

All Firezone components follow the structure above, so it is trivial to
determine which clients work with which gateways and for how long.

## Auto-updates

In general we recommend keeping clients and gateways as up-to-date as possible.
See below for auto-update details for each client.

<TabsGroup>
  <TabsItem title="macOS" active>
    Enable auto-updates in Settings.app.
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="iOS">Enable auto-updates in Settings.app.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Android">Enable app auto-updates in Settings.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="ChromeOS">Enable app auto-updates in Settings.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Linux">
    Linux auto-updates are configured by default if you deployed using the Linux
    client deployment guide.
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Gateway">
    Gateway auto-updates are configured by default if you deployed using the
    Linux client deployment guide.
  </TabsItem>
</TabsGroup>

## Upgrading gateways with minimal downtime

Gateways deployed in the same site will automatically
[failover](/kb/deploy/gateways#failover) for each other. By upgrading gateways
one-by-one, clients connected to the gateway being upgraded will automatically
reconnect to an available gateway.

Currently the failover timeout is maximum 25 seconds, so upgrades should be
performed during a scheduled maintenance window to ensure minimal disruption.
Other than a possible short-term connection interruption to in-use resources,
users won't be impacted by upgrading high-availability gateways.
