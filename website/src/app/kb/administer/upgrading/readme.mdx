# Upgrading Firezone

Upgrading Firezone consists of upgrading the client applications and gateways.
Read more below to understand how our versioning system works, how you can
auto-update these components, and suggestions for an upgrade strategy in
high-availability deployments.

## How versioning works in Firezone

Firezone uses a semantic versioning scheme in the standard
`MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH` format with the following structure:

| Version type | Example    | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAJOR`      | `1`        | Marketing version. Updates to this version generally constitute a new architecture or product. Updated every few years on average.                                                                               |
| `MINOR`      | `20231001` | API version. Clients and gateways **must** be the same API version to function together. The Firezone admin portal supports the latest **two** API versions at the same time. Updated every 6 months on average. |
| `PATCH`      | `11`       | Patch version. Represents backwards-compatible bug fixes and updates that are generally recommended for all users. Updated on average every week.                                                                |

All Firezone components follow the structure above, so it is trivial to
determine which clients work with which gateways and for how long.

## Auto-updates

In general we recommend keeping clients and gateways as up-to-date as possible.
See below for auto-update details for each client.

<TabsGroup>
  <TabsItem title="macOS" active>
    Enable auto-updates in Settings.app.
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="iOS">Enable auto-updates in Settings.app.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Android">Enable app auto-updates in Settings.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="ChromeOS">Enable app auto-updates in Settings.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Linux">
    Linux auto-updates are configured by default if you deployed using the Linux
    client deployment guide.
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Gateway">
    Gateway auto-updates are configured by default if you deployed using the
    Linux client deployment guide.
  </TabsItem>
</TabsGroup>

## Upgrading gateways with minimal downtime

Gateways deployed in a [high availability](/kb/deploy/gateway#high-availability)
configuration can be updated to new versions one-by-one so clients connected to
the gateway being updated will automatically reconnect to an available gateway.

Currently the failover timeout is maximum 120 seconds, so upgrades should be
performed during a scheduled maintenance window to ensure end-users experience
minimal disruption. Other than a possible short-term connection interruption to
in-use resources, users won't be impacted by upgrading high-availability
gateways.
