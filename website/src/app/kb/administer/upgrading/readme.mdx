# Upgrading Firezone

Upgrading Firezone consists of upgrading the Clients and Gateways. Read more
below to understand how our versioning system works, how you can auto-update
these components, and suggestions for an upgrade strategy in high-availability
deployments.

## How versioning works in Firezone

Firezone uses a semantic version scheme in the following format:

`MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`

Firezone is changing rapidly, so we currently recommend staying as up-to-date as
possible to make sure you have the latest bug fixes and performance improvements
in place.

All components currently have a major version of `1` -- this is not expected to
change for some time.

## Client application auto-updates

In general we recommend keeping Clients and Gateways as up-to-date as possible.
See below for auto-update details for each platform.

<TabsGroup>
  <TabsItem title="macOS" active>
    Enable auto-updates in Settings.app.
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="iOS">Enable auto-updates in Settings.app.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Android">Enable app auto-updates in Settings.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="ChromeOS">Enable app auto-updates in Settings.</TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Windows">
    A UI alert is shown upon launch if the Windows Client has an update
    available.
  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem title="Linux">
    Auto-updates depend on your package manager configuration and deployment
    method.

## Upgrading Gateways

Upgrading a Gateway generally consists of simply replacing the binary or Docker
image and then restarting. See below for specific steps depending on how you've
deployed your Gateway:

<TabsGroup>
<TabsItem title="Docker" active>

Run the following upgrade script which pulls the latest image, stops the running
Gateway, and then restarts it using the newer image with the same configuration.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/main/scripts/gateway-docker-upgrade.sh | bash
```

### Verification

After running the upgrade, you can verify the Gateway is running the latest
version by ensuring the sha256 hash of the pulled image matches the latest
[artifact published on GitHub](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/pkgs/container/gateway/184806062?tag=latest):

  src="/images/kb/administer/upgrading/gateway-upgrade-verify.png"
  width={500}
  height={500}
  className="mx-auto"
  alt="Gateway upgrade verification"
/>

```bash
# Get the sha256 hash of the gateway image running on your system
> docker inspect ghcr.io/firezone/gateway:1.0 --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'

# Ensure this hash matches the latest available image above
ghcr.io/firezone/gateway@sha256:0516fa4a305fac10571238db2b7bf02e6adeda0fb5afc1fe7e8d0c4d0a93ebc6
```

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="systemd">

If you deployed via the portal, your unit file should already contain logic
necessary to upgrade the Gateway on service start. Simply move the old binary
and restart the service to trigger the upgrade:

```bash
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/firezone-gateway /usr/local/bin/firezone-gateway.bak
sudo systemctl restart firezone-gateway
```

</TabsItem>
</TabsGroup>

### Downtime considerations

Gateways deployed within the same Site will automatically
[failover](/kb/deploy/gateways#failover) for each other. By upgrading Gateways
one-by-one, Clients connected to the Gateway being upgraded will automatically
reconnect to an available Gateway.

Upgrades should be performed during a scheduled maintenance window to ensure
minimal disruption. Other than a possible short-term connection interruption to
in-use Resources, users won't otherwise be impacted by upgrading Gateways within
the same Site.
