# Upgrading Gateways

Firezone Gateways are designed to be easily upgraded with little or no planned
downtime for your organization. This guide will walk you through the steps to
upgrade your Gateway for both Docker and systemd deployments.

<Alert color="info">
  This guide covers Gateway upgrades only. For details on upgrading Clients,
  refer to the appropriate [user guide](/kb/user-guides) for your platform.
</Alert>

## Upgrade process

Upgrading a Gateway generally consists of simply replacing the binary or Docker
image with the newer version and then restarting. See below for specific steps
depending on how you've deployed your Gateway:

<TabsItem title="Docker" active>

Copy-paste the following command to upgrade your Docker-based Gateway:

```
curl -fsSL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/main/scripts/gateway-docker-upgrade.sh \
  | bash
```

  >
    View script source
  </Link>
</div>)}

### Verification

After running the upgrade, you can verify the Gateway is running the latest
version by ensuring the sha256 hash of the pulled image matches the latest
[artifact published on GitHub](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/pkgs/container/gateway/184806062?tag=latest):

```
# Get the sha256 hash of the gateway image running on your system
> docker inspect ghcr.io/firezone/gateway:1.0 --format='{{index .RepoDigests 0}}'

# Ensure this hash matches the latest available image above
ghcr.io/firezone/gateway@sha256:0516fa4a305fac10571238db2b7bf02e6adeda0fb5afc1fe7e8d0c4d0a93ebc6
```

</TabsItem>
<TabsItem title="systemd">

If you deployed via the portal, your unit file should already contain logic
necessary to upgrade the Gateway on service start. Simply move the old binary
and restart the service to trigger the upgrade:

```
sudo mv /usr/local/bin/firezone-gateway /usr/local/bin/firezone-gateway.bak
sudo systemctl restart firezone-gateway
```

</TabsItem>
</TabsGroup>

### Downtime considerations

Gateways deployed within the same Site will automatically
[failover](/kb/deploy/gateways#failover) for each other. By upgrading Gateways
one-by-one in a rolling update strategy, Clients connected to the Gateway being
upgraded will automatically reconnect to an available Gateway.

Users may notice very brief interruptions to Resources for a few seconds as
their Client reconnects to a healthy Gateway.
