# Access a Remote Host

</PlanBadge>

In this guide, we'll use Firezone to secure access to a host based on the
host's private IP address.

This is useful when you have a host that may be behind a firewall that you want
to keep secure, but still need to access it from external networks like the
internet.

After completing this guide, you'll be able to access the host using its private
IP address and any services running on it, like SSH or RDP.

## Prerequisites

- A Site that contains the host you want to secure access to.
  [Create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites) if you haven't already.
- One or more Gateways deployed within the Site.
  [Deploy a Gateway](/kb/deploy/gateways) if you don't have any in the Site
  where this host is located.

<Alert color="warning">
  Opening ports on your network firewall is **not** necessary or recommended.
  Firezone Gateways perform secure NAT traversal for you.
</Alert>

## Step 1: Create a Resource

1. In your [admin portal](https://app.firezone.dev), go to `Sites -> <site>` and
   click the `Add Resource` button.
1. Select `IP` as the Resource type.
1. Enter the private IP address of the host you want to secure access to. This
   should be an IP that's directly reachable from the Gateway(s) in your Site.
1. Name the Resource something descriptive, like `SJC File Server`. You'll refer
   to this name when creating a Policy in the next step.
1. Click `Save`.

## Step 2: Create a Policy

1. In the `Policies` tab, click the `Add Policy` button.
1. Select an appropriate Group and the the Resource you created in Step (1).
1. Click `Save`.

## Step 3: Done!

You should now be able to access the host using the private IP address you
specified in Step (1).
