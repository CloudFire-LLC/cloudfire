# Access a Private Web Application

</PlanBadge>

In this guide, we'll use Firezone to set up access to a private web application
such as GitLab or Metabase. This is useful when you have a web app hosted behind
a firewall that you want to keep secure, but still need to access it from
external networks like the internet.

<Alert color="info">
  This steps in this guide can be effectively applied to virtually any service,
  not just web applications.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- A Site that contains the web app you want to secure access to.
  [Create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites) if you haven't already.
- One or more Gateways deployed within the Site.
  [Deploy a Gateway](/kb/deploy/gateways) if you don't have any in the Site
  where this web app is located.

<Alert color="warning">
  For reliable access to high-traffic web apps, set up
  multiple Gateways for load balancing. See [Deploying multiple
  Gateways](/kb/deploy/gateways#deploying-multiple-gateways).

## Step 1: Create a Resource

1. In your [admin portal](https://app.firezone.dev), go to `Sites -> <site>` and
   click the `Add Resource` button.
1. Select `DNS` as the Resource type.
1. Enter the address of the web app you want to secure access to. For example:
   `metabase.company.com`. This address must be resolvable by all of the
   Gateway(s) in your Site.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the Resource, e.g.
   `Procurement team Metabase instance`. This will be used to identify the
   Resource in the Firezone admin portal.

## Step 2: Create a Policy

1. In the `Policies` tab, click the `Add Policy` button.
1. Create a Policy for the Resource you created in Step (1). Be sure to select
   the appropriate Group and Resource for the Policy.

## Step 3: Done!

You've now secured access to your private web app with Firezone. You can now
test access from any signed-in Client by visiting the address you specified in
Step (1):
