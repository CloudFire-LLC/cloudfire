# Block Malicious DNS Queries

</PlanBadge>

In this guide we'll walk through how to configure custom DNS resolvers in your
Firezone account to block malicious or unwanted DNS queries.

This is commonly used by organizations to improve Internet security across their
workforce. Blocking malicious DNS queries can prevent malware from communicating
with command and control servers and reduce the risk of phishing attacks.

## Prerequisites

- A Firezone account. Sign up [here](https://app.firezone.dev/sign_up) if you
  don't have one already.
- Firezone Client installed on the devices you want to protect. The Firezone
  Client **must be installed and signed in** for this configuration to take
  effect. See our installation guides for each platform [here](/kb/user-guides).

## Step 1: Choose a resolver to use

You'll first need one or more DNS resolvers to use. See the table below for
examples of some popular providers that offer malware-blocking and
privacy-focused DNS resolvers for public use:

| Provider                      | DNS filtering IP(s)                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloudflare                    | `1.1.1.2`, `1.0.0.2`, `2606:4700:4700::1112`, `2606:4700:4700::1002` |
| Quad9                         | `9.9.9.11`, `149.112.112.11`, `2620:fe::11`, `2620:fe::fe:11`        |
| Comodo Secure DNS             | `8.26.56.26`, `8.20.247.20`                                          |
| dns0.eu                       | `193.110.81.9`, `185.253.5.9`                                        |
| CleanBrowsing Security Filter | `185.228.168.9`, `185.228.169.9`, `2a0d:2a00:1::2`, `2a0d:2a00:2::2` |
| NextDNS                       | Varies. See [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) for more information.     |

<Alert color="warning">
  Each provider blocks different domains. We recommend testing a few providers
  to see which one works best for you.
</Alert>

## Step 2: Add the resolver in Firezone

1. [Sign in](https://app.firezone.dev) to your Firezone account and navigate to
   the `Settings -> DNS` tab.
1. Add each of the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers you want to use in the
   **Client DNS** section.
1. Click **Save** to apply the changes. The Firezone Clients will automatically
   update their configuration to use the new DNS resolvers.

<Alert color="info">
  Firezone only supports upstream resolvers available over UDP/53. See [this
  GitHub issue](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/4668) if you need
  support for DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) resolvers.
</Alert>

## Step 3: Verify

You can verify that DNS is being filtered by querying a known malicious domain
from a device with the Firezone Client signed in and checking if you receive an
answer of `0.0.0.0` or `NXDOMAIN`.

For example, the `zeustracker.abuse.ch` domain is associated with the Zeus
botnet and is commonly blocked by many DNS providers:

```text
> dig zeustracker.abuse.ch

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @1.1.1.1 zeustracker.abuse.ch
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NXDOMAIN, id: 63245
;; flags: qr rd ra ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 1232
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;zeustracker.abuse.ch.		IN	A

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
abuse.ch.		300	IN	SOA	ns-cloud-d1.googledomains.com. cloud-dns-hostmaster.google.com. 2 21600 3600 259200 300

;; Query time: 256 msec
;; SERVER: 100.100.111.1#53(100.100.111.1)
;; WHEN: Thu Apr 18 08:05:28 PDT 2024
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 142
```

If you're using one of the **Cloudflare** filtering resolvers mentioned above,
you can test with `malware.testcategory.com` which Cloudflare provides to check
if DNS filtering is working correctly:

```text
> dig malware.testcategory.com

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> @1.1.1.2 malware.testcategory.com
; (1 server found)
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 57424
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 1232
; OPT=15: 00 10 ("..")
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;malware.testcategory.com.	IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
malware.testcategory.com. 60	IN	A	0.0.0.0

;; Query time: 52 msec
;; SERVER: 100.100.111.1#53(100.100.111.1)
;; WHEN: Thu Apr 18 08:02:34 PDT 2024
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 75
```
