# Access a Postgres Database

</PlanBadge>

In this guide, we'll use Firezone to set up access to a Postgres database. This
is useful when you have a Postgres database that you want to keep behind a
firewall, but still need to access it from external networks like the internet.

<Alert color="info">
  This steps in this guide can be effectively applied to virtually any database
  or service, not just Postgres.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- A Site that will contain the Postgres database you want to secure access to.
  [Create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites) if you haven't already.
- One or more Gateways deployed within the Site.
  [Deploy a Gateway](/kb/deploy/gateways) if you don't have any in the Site
  where this database is located.

<Alert color="warning">
  We recommend setting up multiple Gateways for load balancing access to
  high-traffic services like databases. See [Deploying multiple
  Gateways](/kb/deploy/gateways#deploying-multiple-gateways).

## Step 1: Create a Resource

1. In your [admin portal](https://app.firezone.dev), go to `Sites -> <site>` and
   click the `Add Resource` button.
1. Select `DNS` or `IP` as the Resource type depending on how you plan to access
   the database. If you're using a DNS name, the address should be resolvable by
   all of the Gateways in your Site.
1. Enter the address of the Postgres database you want to secure access to.

  />

## Step 2: Create a Policy

1. In the `Policies` tab, click the `Add Policy` button.
1. Create a Policy for the Resource you created in Step (1). Be sure to select
   the appropriate Group and Resource for the Policy.

## Step 3: Done!

You've now secured access to your Postgres database. You can test the connection
by testing access to the database with a tool like `psql`:

```
psql -h <resource-address> -U <username> -d <database>
```

If you get a password prompt, you've successfully secured access to your
Postgres database.
