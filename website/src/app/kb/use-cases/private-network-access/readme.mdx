# Access a Private Network

</PlanBadge>

In this guide, we'll be using Firezone to secure access to a private subnet
behind a firewall.

This is useful when you have hosts or services behind a firewall that you want
to keep secure, but still need to access it from external networks like the
internet.

<Alert color="warning">
  In general, we recommend using a more granular approach to secure access using
  either [DNS](/kb/use-cases/web-app-access) or
  [IP-based](/kb/use-cases/host-access) Resources instead of the blanket
  approach used in this guide. Only use this guide if using DNS
  or IP-based Resources is not feasible, or if you need a stepping stone towards a more granular approach.
</Alert>

## Prerequisites

- A Site that contains the subnet you want to secure access to.
  [Create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites) if you haven't already.
- One or more Gateways deployed within the Site.
  [Deploy a Gateway](/kb/deploy/gateways) if you don't have any in the Site
  where this subnet is located.

<Alert color="warning">
  Opening ports on your network firewall is **not** necessary or recommended.
  Firezone Gateways perform secure NAT traversal for you.
</Alert>

## Step 1: Create a Resource

1. In your [admin portal](https://app.firezone.dev), go to `Sites -> <site>` and
   click the `Add Resource` button.
1. Select `CIDR` as the Resource type.
1. Enter the CIDR range of the subnet you want to secure access to. This should
   be a range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that's directly reachable from the
   Gateway(s) in your Site.
1. Name the Resource something descriptive, like `SJC demo net`. You'll refer to
   this name when creating a Policy in the next step.
1. Click `Save`.

## Step 2: Create a Policy

1. In the `Policies` tab, click the `Add Policy` button.
1. Select an appropriate Group and the the Resource you created in Step (1).
1. Click `Save`.

## Step 3: Done!

You should now be able to access hosts and services in the subnet you specified
in Step (1).
