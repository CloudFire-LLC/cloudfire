# Manage Access to a SaaS Application

</PlanBadge>

In this guide, we'll use Firezone to manage access to a public SaaS application
such as
[HubSpot](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account-security/limit-logins-to-trusted-ip-addresses)
or
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/keeping-your-organization-secure/managing-security-settings-for-your-organization/managing-allowed-ip-addresses-for-your-organization).

This is useful when you want to restrict access to a public web app based on an
IP allowlist configured in the app, effectively turning the Firezone Gateway
into an **app connector** for SaaS applications that support IP allowlists.

## Prerequisites

- A Site with a descriptive name to use for deploying Gateways for this use
  case, for example `SaaS connectors`. [Create a Site](/kb/deploy/sites) if you
  haven't already.
- One or more Gateways deployed within the Site in a NAT Gateway configuration.
  See [Route traffic through a public IP](/kb/use-cases/nat-gateway) for how to
  deploy a single NAT Gateway, or see our
  [Terraform examples](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/tree/main/terraform/examples)
  for examples on how to automate deploying multiple Gateways to various cloud
  providers.
- Any SaaS app that supports IP allowlists, configured to allow the public IP
  address(es) of the Gateway(s) you want to use.

<Alert color="warning">
  For reliable access to your SaaS apps, we always recommend deploying multiple
  Gateways for high availability.

## Step 1: Create a Resource

1. In your [admin portal](https://app.firezone.dev), go to `Sites -> <site>` and
   click the `Add Resource` button.
1. Select `DNS` as the Resource type.
1. Enter the address of the SaaS app you want to secure access to. In some
   cases, it's helpful to use wildcard matching to ensure all subdomains for the
   SaaS app are routed appropriately as well. For example: `*.github.com`. This
   address must be resolvable by all of the Gateway(s) in your Site.
1. Enter a descriptive name for the Resource, e.g. `Public GitHub access`. This
   will be used to identify the Resource in the Firezone admin portal.

## Step 2: Create a Policy

1. In the `Policies` tab, click the `Add Policy` button.
1. Create a Policy for the Resource you created in Step (1). Be sure to select
   the appropriate Group and Resource for the Policy.

## Step 3: Done!

You've now secured access to your private web app with Firezone. You can now
test access from any signed-in Client by visiting the SaaS app in a web browser.
