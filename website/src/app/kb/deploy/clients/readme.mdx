# Distribute Clients

</PlanBadge>

Firezone provides native clients for all major platforms. Use these clients on
end-user devices, servers, and any other machine that needs access to your
protected Resources.

## Installation

See our [client app guides](/kb/client-apps) for basic installation and usage
instructions for the Firezone Client that are appropriate for all Firezone
users. Or continue reading below for [MDM](#deploy-with-mdm) deployment and
[headless mode](#headless-mode-operation) instructions suited for Firezone
admins wishing to deploy the clients at scale across their organization.

## Provision with MDM

Provisioning the Firezone client onto end-user devices should work out of the
box using any of the major MDM vendors using the appropriate distribution method
below. If you find an exception, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/new/choose)
so we can prioritize appropriately.

| Platform           | Distribution Method                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android / ChromeOS | The Android / ChromeOS client is available exclusively from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.firezone.android).             |
| Linux              | The headless and GUI Linux clients are available from our [changelog page](/changelog).                                                                              |
| iOS                | The iOS client is available exclusively from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firezone/id6443661826).                                             |
| macOS              | The macOS client is available either from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firezone/id6443661826) or as a [standalone distributable](/changelog). |
| Windows            | The Windows client is available as a standalone MSI installer from our [changelog page](/changelog).                                                                 |

### Allowlisting the macOS System Extension

The macOS client version 1.4.0 and higher includes a System Extension that must
be enabled in order to function. For MDM-managed devices, the System Extension
can be allowlisted to eliminate the need for the user to perform this step
manually.

Follow one of the guides below for your MDM provider:

- [Jamf Pro](https://developer.jamf.com/jamf-pro/docs/kernel-and-system-extensions#system-extensions)
- [Kandji](https://support.kandji.io/kb/system-extensions-overview-and-guide)
- [JumpCloud](https://jumpcloud.com/support/create-mac-system-extension-policy)
- [Hexnode](https://www.hexnode.com/mobile-device-management/help/how-to-configure-system-extensions-on-macos-devices/)
- [InTune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/kernel-extensions-overview-macos)

Use `47R2M6779T` for the team identifier and
`dev.firezone.firezone.network-extension` for the extension bundle identifier.

## Headless mode operation

The Firezone Client can run in headless mode on Linux, Android, and ChromeOS
platforms using a [Service Account](/kb/authenticate/service-accounts) token.
This mode is useful for deploying the Client on servers, IoT devices, and other
headless devices where a user may not be present to keep the Client
authenticated.

See the table below for achieving headless mode operation on each platform:

| Platform           | Headless Mode Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android / ChromeOS | Set the `token` key using an MDM provider that supports Android [managed configurations](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations). If the token is set and valid, Firezone will automatically connect and authenticate using this token when the Client is started. |
| Linux              | See the [Linux Headless Client](/kb/client-apps/linux-headless-client) guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| macOS / iOS        | Not yet supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Windows            | See the [Windows Headless Client](/kb/client-apps/windows-headless-client) guide.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
