# Distribute clients

Firezone provides native clients for all major platforms. Use these clients on
end-user devices, servers, and any other machine that needs access to your
protected resources.

## User installation

See our [end-user instructions](/kb/user-guides/) for basic installation and
usage instructions for the Firezone client apps that are appropriate for all
Firezone users. Or continue reading below for [MDM](#deploy-with-mdm) deployment
and [headless mode](#headless-mode-operation) instructions suited for advanced
users and Firezone admins.

## Provision with MDM

Provisioning the Firezone client onto end-user devices should work out of the
box using any of the major MDM vendors using the appropriate distribution method
below. If you find an exception, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/new/choose)
so we can prioritize appropriately.

| Platform           | Distribution Method                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS / iOS        | The macOS and iOS clients are available exclusively from the Apple App Store.                                                                       |
| Android / ChromeOS | The Android / ChromeOS client is available exclusively from the Google Play Store.                                                                  |
| Windows            | The Windows client is available as a standalone MSI installer from our [releases page](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).          |
| Linux              | The Linux client is available as a standalone statically-linked binary from our [releases page](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/releases). |

## Headless mode operation

The Firezone client can run in headless mode on Linux, Android, and ChromeOS
platforms using a [Service Account](/kb/authenticate/service-accounts) token.
This mode is useful for deploying the client on servers, IoT devices, and other
headless devices where a user may not be present to keep the client
authenticated.

See the table below for achieving headless mode operation on each platform:

| Platform           | Headless Mode Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Windows            | Not yet supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Android / ChromeOS | Set the `token` key using an MDM provider that supports Android [managed configurations](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations). If the token is set and valid, Firezone will automatically connect and authenticate using this token when the client is started. |
| Linux              | Set the `FIREZONE_TOKEN` environment variable when running the client binary.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
