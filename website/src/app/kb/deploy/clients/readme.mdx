# Deploy Clients

Firezone provides native clients for all major platforms. Use these clients on
end-user devices, servers, and any other machine that needs access to your
protected resources.

## Deploy with MDM

In most cases, deploying the Firezone client using your MDM provider of choice
is supported. If you find an exception, please open a GitHub issue so we can
prioritize supporting your MDM provider appropriately.

## Download

During beta, the Firezone team will provide you with invite links you can send
to your end-users to install clients on macOS, iOS, and Android platforms. Due
to restrictions imposed by Apple and Google on VPN applications, these clients
can only be installed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store
respectively.

On Windows and Linux platforms, you can find the latest clients published at our
[main repository releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
