# Deploy clients

Firezone provides native clients for all major platforms. Use these clients on
end-user devices, servers, and any other machine that needs access to your
protected resources.

See our [end-user guides](/kb/user-guides/) for basic installation and usage
instructions that are appropriate for all Firezone users. Or continue reading
below for more advanced deployment options and headless mode operation for
advanced users and Firezone admins.

## Deploy with MDM

In most cases, deploying the Firezone client using your MDM provider of choice
is supported. If you find an exception, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/new/choose)
so we can prioritize support for a particular MDM provider appropriately.

See the table below for general MDM deployment instructions:

| Platform | Notes                                                                                        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | The macOS client available exclusively from the Apple App Store for macOS. Your MDM provider |

## Headless mode operation

## Download

During beta, the Firezone team will provide you with invite links you can send
to your end-users to install clients on macOS, iOS, and Android platforms. Due
to restrictions imposed by Apple and Google on VPN applications, these clients
can only be installed from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store
respectively.

On Windows and Linux platforms, you can find the latest clients published at our
[main repository releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
