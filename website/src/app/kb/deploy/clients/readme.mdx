# Deploy Clients

Firezone provides clients for all major platforms.

During beta, the Firezone team will provide you with invite links you can
forward to your end-users to install clients on macOS, iOS, and Android
platforms.

On Windows and Linux platforms, you can find the latest clients published at our
[main repository releases page](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases).
