# Distribute Clients

</PlanBadge>

Firezone provides native clients for all major platforms. Use these clients on
end-user devices, servers, and any other machine that needs access to your
protected Resources.

## Installation

See our [end-user instructions](/kb/user-guides/) for basic installation and
usage instructions for the Firezone Client that are appropriate for all Firezone
users. Or continue reading below for [MDM](#deploy-with-mdm) deployment and
[headless mode](#headless-mode-operation) instructions suited for Firezone
admins wishing to deploy the clients at scale across their organization.

## Provision with MDM

Provisioning the Firezone client onto end-user devices should work out of the
box using any of the major MDM vendors using the appropriate distribution method
below. If you find an exception, please
[open a GitHub issue](https://www.github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/new/choose)
so we can prioritize appropriately.

| Platform           | Distribution Method                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android / ChromeOS | The Android / ChromeOS client is available exclusively from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.firezone.android). |
| Linux              | The headless and GUI Linux clients are available from our [changelog page](/changelog).                                                                  |
| macOS / iOS        | The macOS and iOS clients are available exclusively from the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firezone/id6443661826).                     |
| Windows            | The Windows client is available as a standalone MSI installer from our [changelog page](/changelog).                                                     |

## Headless mode operation

The Firezone Client can run in headless mode on Linux, Android, and ChromeOS
platforms using a [Service Account](/kb/authenticate/service-accounts) token.
This mode is useful for deploying the Client on servers, IoT devices, and other
headless devices where a user may not be present to keep the Client
authenticated.

See the table below for achieving headless mode operation on each platform:

| Platform           | Headless Mode Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Android / ChromeOS | Set the `token` key using an MDM provider that supports Android [managed configurations](https://developer.android.com/work/managed-configurations). If the token is set and valid, Firezone will automatically connect and authenticate using this token when the Client is started. |
| Linux              | Set the `FIREZONE_TOKEN` and `FIREZONE_ID` environment variables when running the Client binary.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| macOS / iOS        | Not yet supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Windows            | Not yet supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
