# Create Resources

</PlanBadge>

Resources define subnets, IP addresses, or DNS names you wish to manage access
for.

To create a Resource, go to `Sites -> <site name> -> Add a Resource`.

<Alert color="info">
  Remember, Resources **must** be reachable by all Gateways in the same Site.
</Alert>

From there, you can select the type of Resource you want to create:

- **DNS**: A domain name pattern to match.
  - By default, the pattern will only match exactly the name you enter.
  - To recursively match all subdomains, use a wildcard, such as
    `*.example.com`. This will match `example.com`, `sub2.example.com`, and
    `sub1.sub2.example.com`.
  - To non-recursively match all subdomains, use a question mark, such as
    `?.example.com`. This will match `example.com`, `sub1.example.com`, and
    `sub2.example.com` **but not** `sub1.sub2.example.com`.
- **IP**: A single IPv4 or IPv6 address
- **CIDR**: A range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in CIDR notation, such as
  `10.1.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/48`

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, once a Resource is created, its address
  cannot be changed. Double-check to ensure the address entered is correct
  before creating the Resource.

### Traffic restrictions

</PlanBadge>

You can specify optional port range(s) and protocols on the Resource for finer
access control, useful for restricting certain services while allowing others.
Supported protocols currently include `ICMP`, `TCP`, and `UDP`.

One popular use case for traffic restrictions is segmenting access to individual
services on a host. To do this, simply create a Resource for each service on the
host you want to allow access to, and add the appropriate traffic restrictions
to each one.

For example, create an Resource with the `TCP/22` restriction to allow SSH
access for your DevOps team, then add another Resource with the `TCP/443`
restriction to allow access to an HTTPS service for the rest of your
organization.
