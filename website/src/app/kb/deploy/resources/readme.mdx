# Create Resources

</PlanBadge>

Resources define subnets, IP addresses, or DNS names you wish to manage access
for.

To create a Resource, go to `Sites` -> `<Site>` -> `Add a Resource`.

<Alert color="info">
  Remember, Resources **must** be reachable by all Gateways in the same Site.
</Alert>

From there, you can select the type of Resource you want to create:

- **DNS**: A domain name pattern to match.
  - By default, the pattern will only match exactly the name you enter.
  - To recursively match all subdomains, use a wildcard, such as
    `*.example.com`. This will match `sub2.example.com`,
    `sub1.sub2.example.com`,
  - To non-recursively match all subdomains, use a question mark, such as
    `?.example.com`. This will match `sub1.example.com` and `sub2.example.com`
    but _not_ `sub1.sub2.example.com`.
- **IP**: A single IPv4 or IPv6 address
- **CIDR**: A range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in CIDR notation, such as
  `10.1.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/48`

Firezone does not currently filter traffic based on any layer 4 details such as
transport protocol (UDP / TCP) or port number. If you're interested in a feature
like this,
[please leave a comment on our public roadmap](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/2030).

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, once a Resource is created, its address
  cannot be changed. Double-check to ensure the address entered is correct
  before creating the Resource.
