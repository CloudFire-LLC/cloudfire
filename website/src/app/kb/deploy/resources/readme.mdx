# Create Resources

</PlanBadge>

Resources define subnets, IP addresses, or DNS names you wish to manage access
for.

To create a Resource, go to `Sites -> <site name> -> Add a Resource`.

<Alert color="info">
  Remember, Resources **must** be reachable by all Gateways in the same Site.
</Alert>

From there, you can select the type of Resource you want to create:

- **DNS**: A domain name pattern to match.
  - By default, the pattern will only match the exact name you enter.
  - To match all subdomains recursively, use a double-wildcard, such as
    `**.example.com`. This will match `example.com`, `sub.example.com`, and
    `sub.sub.example.com`.
  - To match all subdomains non-recursively, use a single wildcard, such as
    `*.example.com`. This will match `sub.example.com` but not
    `sub.sub.example.com`.
  - To match a single character, use a question mark, such as
    `us-east?.example.com`. This will match `us-east1.example.com` but not
    `us-eastXY.example.com`.
  - Wildcards can be placed between domain components, e.g., `foo.*.example.com`
    will match `foo.bar.example.com` or `foo.**.example.com` will match
    `foo.bar.baz.example.com`.
- **IP**: A single IPv4 or IPv6 address
- **CIDR**: A range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses in CIDR notation, such as
  `10.1.2.0/24` or `2001:db8::/48`

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** Once a Resource is created, its address cannot be changed.
  Double-check to ensure the address entered is correct before creating the
  Resource.
</Alert>

#### Routing order for overlapping addresses

When multiple Resources' addresses overlap, the Resource with the more specific
address will be used. For CIDR Resources, this means the Resource with the
longest prefix length will be used.

For DNS Resources, the more specific match will be used according to the
following rules:

- Resources without wildcards are always prioritized over wildcard domains: For example, `app.example.com` is checked before `*.example.com`.
- Single-char wildcards (`?`) take priority over label wildcards (`*`): For example, `???.example.com` is checked before `*.example.com`.
- Label wildcards (`*`) take priority over catch-all wildcards (`**`): For example, `*.example.com` is checked before `**.example.com`.

### Address description

When creating a Resource, you'll be given the option to add an
`address_description`. If given, this will be displayed in the Client's Resource
list to help identify the Resource. If a URL is entered, it will be displayed as
a clickable link.

<Link
  target="_blank"
  href="/images/kb/deploy/resources/address_description.png"
>
  <Image
    src="/images/kb/deploy/resources/address_description.png"
    alt="Address description field"
    width={600}
    height={600}
    className="mx-auto"
  />
</Link>

This is commonly used to show a different address to end users than the one used
for routing, where field validations are more restrictive. This can be useful to
provide a bookmark to a service like `https://gitlab.company.com`, or give hints
for accessing the service, like `10.0.0.1:2222`.

### Traffic restrictions

</PlanBadge>

You can specify optional port range(s) and protocols on the Resource for finer
access control, useful for restricting certain services while allowing others.
Supported protocols currently include `ICMP`, `TCP`, and `UDP`.

One popular use case for traffic restrictions is segmenting access to individual
services on a host. To do this, simply create a Resource for each service on the
host you want to allow access to, and add the appropriate traffic restrictions
to each one.

For example, create an Resource with the `TCP/22` restriction to allow SSH
access for your DevOps team, then add another Resource with the `TCP/443`
restriction to allow access to an HTTPS service for the rest of your
organization.

### The Internet Resource

</PlanBadge>

The Internet Resource is a special Resource available on paid plans that allows
you to route `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` through Firezone in a full-tunnel
configuration. It functions as a fallback for traffic that doesn't match any
other Resource.

<Alert color="warning">
  Unlike regular Resources, the Internet Resource can be disabled by end-users
  to prevent their internet access from being affected by Firezone if any issues
  arise. The Internet Resource is <strong>disabled by default</strong> in Client
  apps when it is first assigned a policy.
</Alert>

The Internet Resource is automatically enabled on Team and Enterprise plans. To
use it, follow these steps:

1. Find the `Internet` Resource in the Resources section of the admin portal.
   Edit it, and make sure it has at least one Site assigned to it.
1. [Create a Policy](/kb/deploy/policies) using the Internet Resource.
1. In the client app, remember to enable the Internet Resource by selecting
   `Enable this resource` in the Resource list.
