# Create Resources

</PlanBadge>

Resources define subnets, IP addresses, or DNS names you wish to manage access
for.

To create a resource, go to `Sites` -> `<site>` -> `Add a resource`. Resources
are expected to be reachable by all gateways in the same site.

DNS-based resources match the address entered and all subdomains.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, once a resource is created, its address
  cannot be changed. Double-check to ensure the address entered is correct
  before creating the resource.
