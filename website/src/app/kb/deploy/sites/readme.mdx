# Sites

Sites represent a shared network environment that gateways and resources exist
in. All gateways and resources in a site should be able to reach each other.

## Data routing

Firezone allows you to select how data is routed to a particular site.

Choose "Firezone Managed Relays" (Enterprise plans only) to allow data to
potentially route through the Firezone-managed Relay network when NAT hole
punching fails. Connections in Firezone are end-to-end encrypted; we can never
decrypt your traffic.

Choose "Direct only" to enforce peer to peer connections between clients and
gateways for this site. If NAT holepunching fails for gateways in the site,
clients will be unable to connect to resources and gateways defined in the site.
