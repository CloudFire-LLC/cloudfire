# Sites

</PlanBadge>

Sites represent a shared network environment that Gateways and Resources exist
within. All Gateways and Resources in a Site must have **unobstructed network
connectivity** to each other.

## What is a Site?

A Site is a collection of Resources and Gateways that are logically grouped
together. A Site can be a physical office location, a data center rack, a
homelab network, VPC, or any other grouping that makes sense for your
organization.

A Site can be as small as a single Gateway running on a single server managing
the access to the Resources on that server, or as large as a data center network
managing access to a cluster of servers.

## Creating a Site

To create a Site, click the `Sites` tab in the left-hand navigation and then
click the `Add Site` button. You will be prompted to enter a name for the Site.

<Alert color="info">
  Don't worry too much about the name of the Site now. You can always change it
  later.
