# Sites

</PlanBadge>

Sites represent a shared network environment that gateways and resources exist
within. All gateways and resources in a site must have **unobstructed network
connectivity** to each other.

## What is a site?

A site is a collection of resources and gateways that are logically grouped
together. A site can be a physical office location, a data center rack, a
homelab network, VPC, or any other grouping that makes sense for your
organization.

A site can be as small as a single gateway running on a single server managing
the access to the resources on that server, or as large as an entire data center
network managing access to an entire cluster of servers.

## Creating a site

To create a site, click the "Sites" tab in the left-hand navigation and then
click the "Add Site" button. You will be prompted to enter a name for the site.
