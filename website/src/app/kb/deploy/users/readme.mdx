# Create Users

Users can be created by going to `Actors` -> `Add Actor` and then selecting
`User` as the actor type.

<Alert color="info">
  Automatic user and group sync is available for Google Workspace, Microsoft
  Entra ID, and Okta providers with the Enterprise plan. [Read
  more](/kb/authenticate/user-group-sync) about how it works or [contact
  sales](/contact/sales) to upgrade.
</Alert>

Users with the `User` role can only sign in to the Firezone clients to access
protected resources, while users with the `Admin` can sign in to the admin
portal to perform administrative tasks as well as sign in to Firezone clients to
access protected resources.

Optionally, you can choose to assign the user to one or more groups. This will
ultimately determine the policies that apply to the user, so it's important to
ensure that the groups have the correct policies defined.

<Alert color="warning">
  Each user is automatically placed in the special `Everyone` group upon
  creation.
