# Deploy a Gateway

This guide covers deployment of the Firezone gateway.

Gateways expect to have unobstructed network-level access to resources within
the same site.

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux distribution with kernel 5.0 or higher
- Docker Engine (for docker-based installs)
- Systemd (for systemd-based installs)

## Deploy with the Admin Portal

Go to `Sites` -> `<site>` -> `Deploy a Gateway` and follow the prompts. This
will deploy a single gateway.

## High availability

Two or more Gateways deployed in the same site will automatically fail over and
load balance for each other.

Fail over takes around 60 to 120 seconds depending the connected clients'
network environment.

Load balancing happens automatically when a client connects and uses a
least-latency approach which always prioritizes gateways with the least latency
to the client in question.
