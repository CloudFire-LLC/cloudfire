# Deploy a Gateway

This guide covers deployment of the Firezone gateway.

Gateways expect to have unobstructed network-level access to resources defined
within the same site as the gateway.

## Prerequisites

- Any Linux distribution with kernel 5.0 or higher
- Docker Engine (for docker-based installs)
- Systemd (for systemd-based installs)

## Firewall considerations

Gateways implement the industry-standard
[STUN](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8489) and
[TURN](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8155.html) protocols to securely
perform NAT traversal and firewall hole-punching. No ingress firewall ports are
required for Gateways to function.

If the network in which your Gateway is deployed performs egress filtering,
you'll need to make sure the following outbound traffic is allowed:

| Host             | (IP Address)         | Port(s)         | Protocol(s)     | Purpose                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| api.firezone.dev | `34.102.202.25`      | `443`           | HTTPS/WebSocket | Control Plane API (IPv4)   |
| api.firezone.dev | `2600:1901:0:620b::` | `443`           | HTTPS/WebSocket | Control Plane API (IPv6)   |
| N/A              | Varies               | `3478`          | STUN            | STUN protocol signaling    |
| N/A              | Varies               | `49152 - 65535` | TURN            | TURN protocol channel data |

## Sizing recommendations

Gateways, like the rest of Firezone's data plane stack, are written in Rust and
are thus resource efficient by nature. A single gateway running on a 2 vCPU VM
with 1 GB of memory should be able to handle hundreds of client connections
under typical usage patterns.

Network throughput is usually constrained by single-thread performance due to
the WireGuard state machine and overhead in the kernel network stack. Still,
most gateways should be able to saturate 1 Gbps under typical conditions.

## Deploy a single gateway

Deploying a single gateway can be accomplished in the admin portal.

Go to `Sites` -> `<site>` -> `Deploy a Gateway` and follow the prompts to deploy
for your preferred environment. This will deploy a single gateway.

See the [upgrading guide](/kb/administer/upgrading) for information on keeping
your gateway up-to-date.

## Deploy multiple gateways

When deploying a gateway from the admin portal, a `FIREZONE_TOKEN` environment
variable is shown. This variable can be reused to deploy multiple gateways
within the same site.

This means you can automate deployment of the gateway using your automation
method of choice, adding as many gateways as necessary for failover and load
balancing.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** Be sure to set a unique `FIREZONE_ID` for each gateway you deploy.
  This can be any non-empty string and is used to identify the gateway in the
  portal for audit trail and logging purposes.

## High availability

Firezone was designed from the ground up to support high availability
requirements. This is achieved through a combination of **automatic failover**
and **load balancing**, both of which are automatically enabled on all plans.

### Automatic failover

Two or more gateways can be deployed within a site to achieve automatic failover
for client connections to resources in that site.

Here's how it works:

- When the admin portal detects a particular gateway is unhealthy, it will stop
  using it for new connection requests to resources in the site.
- Existing clients will remain connected to the gateway until they themselves
  detect it to be unhealthy.
- Clients detect unhealthy gateways by maintaining keepalive timers with
  gateways they're connected to. If the keepalive timer expires, the client will
  disconnect from that gateway and ask the portal for a new, healthy one to
  connect to.
- On average, the client keepalive timer expires after **20 seconds**. This is
  the maximum time it takes for existing client connections to be rerouted to a
  healthy gateway in the event of a gateway failure.

By using two independent health checks in the portal and the client, Firezone
ensures that temporary network issues or transient gateway failures do not
affect other clients connected to the same gateway.

### Load balancing

Similar to automatic failover, two or more gateways deployed within a site will
automatic load balance client connections to resources in that site.

When a client wants to connect to a resource, Firezone randomly picks a random
healthy gateway in the site to serve the resource being requested. The client
will then stay connected to that gateway until either the client disconnects or
the gateway becomes unhealthy.

Deploy as many gateways as you need to handle the load of client connections to
resources in a site. This effectively shards client connections across all
gateways in a site, achieving higher overall throughput than otherwise possible
with a single gateway.
