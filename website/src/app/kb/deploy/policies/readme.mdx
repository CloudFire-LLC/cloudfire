# Create Policies

Policies are what grant users access to resources.

To define a policy, go to `Policies` -> `Add Policy`.

Policies define a single group access to a single resource.

<Alert
  color="warning"
  html={`
    <strong>Note:</strong> To preserve audit trails, policy
    access cannot be changed once a policy is created.
    Double-check to ensure the group and resource selected
    are correct before creating the policy.
  `}
