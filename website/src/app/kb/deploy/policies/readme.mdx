# Create Policies

</PlanBadge>

Policies are what grant users access to Resources.

To define a Policy, go to `Policies -> Add Policy`.

Policies define a single Group's access to a single Resource.

<PlanBadge plans={["team", "enterprise"]}>

## Conditional access policies

</PlanBadge>

On Team and higher plans, you may optionally restrict access further based on
the following conditions:

- **Client location**: Restrict access only to Clients connecting from specific
  countries.
- **IP address or CIDR**: Restrict access to a specific IP address or range of
  Client IP addresses.
- **Time of day**: Restrict access to certain time windows.
- **Authentication method**: Restrict access based on the authentication
  provider that was used to authenticate the Client.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, Policy details cannot be changed once a
  Policy is created. Double-check to ensure the Group, Resource, and/or
  conditions are correct before creating the Policy.
