# Create Policies

</PlanBadge>

Policies are what grant users access to Resources.

To define a Policy, go to `Policies -> Add Policy`.

Policies define a single Group's access to a single Resource.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, Policy details cannot be changed once a
  Policy is created. Double-check to ensure the Group, Resource, and/or
  conditions are correct before creating the Policy.

Restrict access only to Clients connecting from specific countries. When this is
specified, the Client's IP address will be used to lookup the country of origin.

### Client IP address or CIDR

Restrict access based on the authentication provider that was used to
authenticate the Client.

### Time of day

Restrict access to certain time windows throughout the week based on the 24hr
time and specified time zone.

The time zone determines the offset used when determining whether to allow
access for a particular Client. For example, if you specify a time window of
`08:00-17:00` and time zone of `Eastern`, Clients in the `Pacific` timezone 3
hours behind will be allowed access from `05:00-14:00` Eastern time.
