# Create Policies

</PlanBadge>

Policies are what grant users access to resources.

To define a policy, go to `Policies` -> `Add Policy`.

Policies define a single group access to a single resource.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, policy access cannot be changed once a
  policy is created. Double-check to ensure the group and resource selected are
  correct before creating the policy.
