# Create Policies

</PlanBadge>

Policies are what grant users access to Resources.

To define a Policy, go to `Policies -> Add Policy`.

Policies define a single Group's access to a single Resource.

<Alert color="warning">
  **Note:** To preserve audit trails, Policy details cannot be changed once a
  Policy is created. Double-check to ensure the Group, Resource, and/or
  conditions are correct before creating the Policy.

## Conditional access policies

</PlanBadge>

On Team and higher plans, you may restrict access further based on the below
conditions.

### Client location

  alt="Client location"
  width={600}
  height={600}
  className="mx-auto shadow rounded"
/>

Restrict access only to Clients connecting from specific countries. When this is
specified, the Client's IP address will be used to lookup the country of origin.

### Client IP address or CIDR

  alt="Client IP address or CIDR"
  width={600}
  height={600}
  className="mx-auto shadow rounded"
/>

Restrict access to a specific IP address or range of Client IP addresses.

### Identity provider

  alt="Identity provider"
  width={600}
  height={600}
  className="mx-auto shadow rounded"
/>

Restrict access based on the authentication provider that was used to
authenticate the Client. This is useful when you want to apply a stricter set of
authentication requirements for certain Groups or Resources using a separate SSO
app in your identity provider.

### Client verification

<Image

  alt="Client verification"
  width={600}
  height={600}
  className="mx-auto shadow rounded"
/>

Restrict access only to verified Clients. When enabled, any Client being used by
the Actors in the group will not be able to access the Resource unless it has
been explicitly marked as verified in the admin portal.

The Client is identified for verification by their unique device IDs, which are
retrieved from the following sources depending on the platform:

| Platform       | Source              | Notes                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MacOS          | Hardware ID         | Matches the hardware ID found in the system report                                                                                        |
| MacOS          | Hardware serial     | Matches the hardware serial found in the system report                                                                                    |
| iOS            | App installation ID | A unique UUIDv4 generated by the system upon app installation. **Note:** This ID will be reset if the app is uninstalled and reinstalled. |
| Android        | App installation ID | A unique UUIDv4 generated by the system upon app installation. **Note:** This ID will be reset if the app is uninstalled and reinstalled. |
| Windows, Linux | Device ID           | The BIOS UUID retried from SMBIOS                                                                                                         |
| Windows, Linux | Motherboard serial  | The mainboard serial retried from SMBIOS                                                                                                  |

This feature acts as a lightweight device management solution, ideal for
organizations looking to enforce device policies (e.g., preventing mobile device
access to production databases) without requiring a full-fledged MDM system to
be in place.

### Time of day

<Image
  src="/images/kb/deploy/policies/client_tod.png"
  alt="Time of day"
  width={600}
  height={600}
  className="mx-auto shadow rounded"
/>

Restrict access to certain time windows throughout the week based on the 24hr
time and specified time zone.

The time zone determines the offset used when determining whether to allow
access for a particular Client. For example, if you specify a time window of
`08:00-17:00` and time zone of `Eastern`, Clients in the `Pacific` timezone 3
hours behind will be allowed access from `05:00-14:00` Eastern time.

### How conflicting policies are resolved

The policy engine resolves access on a boolean OR basis. That means when two or
more policies with conflicting conditions apply to a given Actor-Resource pair,
access will be allowed to the Resource **if any of the policies evaluate true**.

As an example, consider the following policies:

| Policy | Group       | Resource      | Condition                |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| `A`    | Engineering | Production DB | Time of day: 08:00-17:00 |
| `B`    | DevOps      | Production DB | None                     |

If an Actor is a member of both the Engineering and DevOps groups, they will be
able to access the Production DB at any time of day since Policy `B` will always
evaluate to true.
