# Configure DNS

</PlanBadge>

Firezone includes a sophisticated DNS routing system available on all plans that
provides Split DNS and fallback resolver configuration for each Firezone Client.
Read more below to understand how it works and how to configure it.

## How DNS works in Firezone

Each Firezone Client embeds a lightweight DNS proxy used to route queries to an
appropriate Gateway for resolution.

The proxy "listens on" IP addresses in the following ranges:

- IPv4: `100.100.111.0/24`
- IPv6: `fd00:2021:1111:8000::100:100:111:0/120`

When a user signs in, the Client configures the host operating system to use
this proxy as the default resolver for all queries on the system.

This is why you'll commonly see `100.100.111.1` or
`fd00:2021:1111:8000::100:100:111:0` as the DNS server responding to DNS queries
when the Firezone Client is signed in.

### Routing DNS queries

When the proxy sees a query, it checks to see if it matches a Resource the user
has access to. If it does, the proxy then finds an appropriate Gateway
associated with the Resource, forwards the query to be resolved on the Gateway,
then returns the result back to the Client to be returned to the application
making the query.

<Alert color="info">
  DNS queries forwarded to Gateways benefit from the same NAT holepunching
  mechanism as any other traffic. No firewall configuration is required to
  achieve Split DNS with Firezone.
</Alert>

If the query doesn't match a Resource, the proxy forwards the query to one of
the [upstream resolvers](#configuring-client-dns-upstream-resolvers) explained
further below.

## Configuring Client DNS upstream resolvers

Upstream DNS in Client can be configured with the servers of your choosing so
that all queries on Client devices will be forwarded to the servers you specify
for all non-Firezone resources.

Go to `Settings` -> `DNS` and enter IPv4 and/or IPv6 servers to use as fallback
resolvers. Firezone Clients will use these servers in the order they are defined
for any query that doesn't match a Resource the user has access to.

<Alert color="warning">
  Firezone Clients support only DNS over UDP/53 at this time. DNS-over-TLS and
  DNS-over-HTTPS upstream servers are not supported yet.
</Alert>

If no custom resolvers are configured, Firezone Clients will fall back to their
default system resolver, typically set by the DHCP server of their local
network.

<Alert color="info">
  Custom resolvers such as
  [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/#1111-for-families)
  or [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io") can be used to block malware, ads, adult
  material and other content for all users in your Firezone account.
</Alert>

## Configuring Gateway resolvers

Firezone makes no assumptions about the DNS environment in which the Gateway
runs. It uses the default system resolver you've configured on the Gateway host.

This resolver is used for DNS Resources defined in your Firezone account so it's
important that your Gateway host has DNS configured properly for Clients to
resolve names successfully.
