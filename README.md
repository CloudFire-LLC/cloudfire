## Overview

[Firezone](https://www.firezone.dev/?utm_source=readme) is an open source
platform to securely manage remote access for any-sized organization. Unlike
most VPNs, Firezone takes a granular, least-privileged approach to access
management with group-based policies that control access to individual
applications, entire subnets, and everything in between.

## Features

Firezone is:

- **Fast:** Built on WireGuardÂ® to be
  [3-4 times](https://wireguard.com/performance/) faster than OpenVPN.
- **Scalable:** Deploy two or more gateways for automatic load balancing and
  failover.
- **Private:** Tunnels are peer-to-peer so packets never route through Firezone
  infrastructure.
- **Secure:** Zero attack surface thanks to Firezone's holepunching tech which
  establishes tunnels on-the-fly at the time of access.
- **Flexible:** Authenticate users via email, Google Workspace, or OIDC and sync
  users and groups automatically.
- **Simple:** Deploy gateways and configure access in minutes with a snappy
  admin UI.

Firezone is **not:**

- A tool for creating bi-directional mesh networks
- A full-featured router or firewall
- An IPSec or OpenVPN server

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

<strong>
> Can I self-host Firezone?
</strong>

Our [license](#license) won't stop you from self-hosting the entire Firezone
product top to bottom, but we can't dedicated the resources to make this a
smooth experience and therefore don't support self-hosting the control plane at
this time.

If you have a business case requiring an onprem installation of Firezone please
[get in touch](https://www.firezone.dev/contact/sales?utm_source=readme).

If you're feeling especially adventurous and want to self-host Firezone for
**educational** or **recreational** purposes, you'll want to build and
distribute the clients from source to ensure they remain locked to a version
compatible with your self-hosted control plane. Unfortunately, the following
clients must be distributed through proprietary app stores due to restrictions
imposed by Apple and Google:

- macOS
- iOS
- Android / ChromeOS

Because it's impossible to select which client version to install from a
particular app store, building Firezone entirely from source is the only way
self-host Firezone at this time.

Otherwise, if you're hobbyist or developer and are looking to spin it up locally
to contribute or experiment with, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

<strong>
> How do I upgrade from 0.7?
</strong>

Unfortunately, you can't. The good news is Firezone 1.x is _much_ easier to
setup and manage than 0.x and so you probably don't need to.

<strong>
> How long will 0.7 be supported until?
</strong>

Firezone 0.7 is current end-of-life and will stop receiving updates after
<strong>January 31st, 2024</strong>.
