The founders were \u201cdigital nomads,\u201d and the team was fully remote.\\n\\nBack in 2016, this was highly uncommon.\\n\\nWe spent a lot of time creating processes to work together effectively on opposite sides of the world. One of these was meeting up in person regularly.\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"800\\"\\n    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/211626078-6f64a4f4-ec37-40cd-8bb5-a6b9b122f351.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"digital nomads\\"\\n  />\\n</center>\\n\\nAt first, it was by accident. Since everyone was traveling anyway, we would coordinate being in the same city at the same time.\\n\\nAfter working in person, we quickly noticed the way we worked remotely improved. People were more comfortable sharing their ideas, better at giving constructive criticism, and happier in general.\\n\\nIt just _felt_ better to work together in person.\\n\\n## Why try this at Firezone?\\n\\nIf you believe Firezone can take a sizable bite out of the usual suspects of legacy remote access products, we\u2019ll need to use every advantage.\\n\\nAs a startup, our biggest advantage is the ability to move quickly as a team.\\n\\nThis is much easier when everyone is comfortable sharing ideas and engaging in lively debate. Plus, it\u2019s a lot more fun.\\n\\nSo we decided to try it out. After much planning, canceled bookings, and a few long flights, our team met in Santa Rosa, California.\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"600\\"\\n    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/216130487-bde66005-e3e0-4d88-a2d0-f9a842efc715.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"offsite office\\"\\n  />\\n</center>\\n\\n## What did we do?\\n\\nOur itinerary included architecture planning, a multi-day hackathon, and plenty of fun activities around the Bay Area.\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"600\\"\\n    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/211988059-02f3083a-116b-462e-a5ff-90af4fab63fc.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"offsite office\\"\\n  />\\n</center>\\n\\nThe focus of the off-site was building. We each defined a few tasks that could realistically be completed by the end of the trip. So what did we work on?\\n\\n- A new Firezone gateway (coming in 0.8!) that will eventually allow decoupling the web portal from the WireGuard data plane. A single Firezone web portal will soon be able to manage hundreds or even thousands of little Firezone gateways securing access to their respective private resources. More details to come!\\n- A [new REST API in 0.7](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases) to allow configuring Firezone in a more automatable way. Users love our snappy web portal, but nothing beats the power of an API for automation.\\n- Various documentation improvements to improve consistency between Omnibus and Docker sections, detail logging, and implement a v1 style guide.\\n\\nOf course, no visit to the Bay Area would be complete without a tour of San Francisco. It rained most of the time, so we missed out on much of the picturesque hiking. But we still managed to snap some photos of the Golden Gate bridge and devour a few In-N-Out burgers.\\n\\nOf special mention are the team dinners. Remote companies lack that familiar bond typically formed over team lunches in the office, so we sought to recreate that when we met in person. As an added bonus, we also split cooking duties. In many ways preparing food for your teammates is like opening a pull request: make something, request feedback on it, then merge and enjoy.\\n\\nAs someone whose culinary talents rival his passion for building security products, our resident chef [Jamil](https://twitter.com/jamilbk) led most of the culinary endeavors, including a 2-hour drive around Santa Rosa in search of live Dungeness crab.\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"400\\"\\n    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167144/214394961-ecbff7d8-2f9c-48a6-a906-c387366169f3.jpeg\\"\\n    alt=\\"team dinner\\"\\n  />\\n</center>\\n\\n## Lessons learned for next time\\n\\nSince this was our first off-site, some things could have gone better. Here\u2019s a small list of hiccups and other things we\u2019d do differently next time.\\n\\n### Turn on low power mode\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"400\\"\\n    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52545545/211503302-4b2e2e74-06e8-4929-aa5b-a336af25a450.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"team dinner\\"\\n  />\\n</center>\\n\\nIf you\u2019re booking an Airbnb, check for planned maintenance and outages! We were notified three days before arrival the power would be out during two full workdays.\\n\\nFortunately, we had a small power bank and mobile hotspot with unlimited data. Unfortunately, our lead Rust engineer\u2019s beefy Linux machine only gets a single hour of battery life on a full charge.\\n\\nWhen his machine died, we migrated to our local coffee shop, where power and WiFi were surprisingly abundant. _Editor\u2019s note: Coffee shops in Santa Rosa are much more accommodating as a makeshift office than most in San Francisco._\\n\\nWhen you\u2019re building software, electricity and internet are vital -- splurge for that bigger battery bank and faster hotspot!\\n\\n### Lumbar support is underrated\\n\\nYou\u2019ll sacrifice some ergonomics when you work out of an Airbnb. Put a premium on large work surfaces, open common areas, and comfortable chairs. After a few days of working hunched over on a sofa, we learned the hard way.\\n\\nEven better, leave heads down work until after the off-site. Instead, prioritize architecture discussions, brainstorming sessions, and design sprints.\\n\\n### Stock the right fuel\\n\\nWe got carried away at Costco. Our out-of-town guests had never witnessed the spectacle of an American snack aisle. Fortunately, our talented engineers can turn Funyuns into elegant lines of Rust code (shoutout [@Gabi](https://github.com/conectado)).\\n\\nAll jokes aside, you\u2019ll need the right fuel for your hackathons and deep product discussions. We recommend stocking up with plenty of coffee and healthy snacks.\\n\\n### Plan ahead: it\u2019ll pay off\\n\\nAs is often the case with startups, we planned the trip on short notice. This meant many last-minute restaurant bookings and trips to the store for basic supplies.\\n\\nSo, make a shopping list, book a few restaurants in advance, and have a backup plan. If you\u2019re looking for a template, take a look at this [guide](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/offsites#how-to-plan-an-offsite-in-8-weeks---a-checklist) from our friends at PostHog. A great checklist is hard to beat.\\n\\n## What\u2019s next?\\n\\nIn a few short days, we:\\n\\n- Aligned on Firezone\u2019s product direction\\n- Made critical architecture decisions for the gateway and client apps\\n- Made significant progress on a few key features\\n- Bonded over great food, conversation, and Mario Kart\\n\\nWe could have accomplished some of these over a few long Zoom calls and chat threads, but not as quickly. There\u2019s something about mind melding over a few days of intense work that\u2019s hard to replicate.\\n\\nSo, will we have another off-site? Definitely!\\n\\nUntil next time!\\n\\n:::info \ud83d\udc4b thanks for reading\\nFirezone secures remote access to private resources. This post doesn\'t have much to do about security, networking, or a fancy new feature. But hey, our product improves the remote work experience - organizing a great off-site helps too.\\n\\nIf you want to try it out, our [Docker install script](/docs/deploy) gets Firezone running in just a few minutes.\\n:::"},{"id":"release-0-6-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-0-6-0","source":"@site/blog/2022-10-17-release-0-6-0/index.mdx","title":"Release 0.6.0","description":"Firezone 0.6 Released!","date":"2022-10-17T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 17, 2022","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"docker","permalink":"/blog/tags/docker"},{"label":"saml","permalink":"/blog/tags/saml"}],"readingTime":3.39,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jamil Bou Kheir","title":"Co-founder","url":"https://github.com/jamilbk","imageURL":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c8434814eec26026718e992322648c8","key":"jamil"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-0-6-0","title":"Release 0.6.0","authors":["jamil"],"tags":["release","docker","saml"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Lessons from Firezone\u2019s first off-site","permalink":"/blog/first-offsite-retro"},"nextItem":{"title":"Release 0.5.0","permalink":"/blog/release-0-5-0"}},"content":"## Firezone 0.6 Released!\\n\\nToday, I\'m excited to announce we\'ve closed the [first public issue\\n](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/issues/260) on our GitHub repository,\\nmore than a year after it was originally opened: Containerization support!\\nWe\'re also releasing preliminary support for SAML 2.0 identity providers\\nlike Okta and OneLogin.\\n\\n### Docker Support\\n\\nDocker is now the preferred method for deploying Firezone. Our [\\nautomatic install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_install.sh)\\nnow uses Docker by default, and we even have a new [Docker migration script\\n](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_migrate.sh)\\nthat will non-destructively migrate your Omnibus-based Firezone installation\\nto a Docker-based one with minimal downtime.\\n\\n#### How to Deploy\\n\\nYou can now deploy Firezone complete with valid SSL certificates and a\\nprovisioned administrator in just a couple minutes:\\n\\n<AsciinemaPlayer\\n  src=\\"https://asciinema.org/a/530197.cast\\"\\n  autoplay={true}\\n  rows={30}\\n  idleTimeLimit={3}\\n  preload={true}\\n/>\\n\\nThis also means Firezone runs on any platform that supports Docker,\\nlike my Mac in the video above. The automatic install script will _probably_\\nbarf on Windows, though. In that case, try the\\n[manual install method](/docs/deploy/docker/#option-2-manual-install)!\\n\\n#### Why Docker?\\n\\nDocker offers a number of benefits over the old Omnibus-based method of deploying\\nFirezone:\\n\\n- **Simpler, more robust upgrades**: In most cases, simply pull the latest `firezone/firezone`\\n  image and restart the container.\\n- **Simpler configuration**: Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can now\\n  be done in the web UI instead of the `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb` configuration\\n  file. All other configuration variables can be specified as ENV vars to the\\n  Firezone container.\\n- **Smaller footprint**: The Firezone image weighs in at a couple dozen\\n  megabytes versus hundreds of megabytes for the Omnibus package.\\n- **Portability**: Firezone now runs on any platform that supports Docker.\\n- **Security**: Containerization providers better security isolation than\\n  simply running as an unprivileged local user.\\n\\nIt also makes it easier to build and test Firezone. CI pipelines rejoice!\\nNo more 4-hour long compiles and intermittent build failures.\\n\\n#### What about Omnibus?\\n\\n[Chef Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) is a Ruby-based build system\\ndesigned to make building and distributing complex software easier. You define\\nyour dependencies as source tarballs, configure options, and platform-specific\\nbuild flags, and Omnibus automatically fetches, builds, and links all your\\ndependencies automagically, emitting an OS-native installer artifact when\\ncomplete.\\n\\nOmnibus was a popular choice for distributing self-hosted software before\\nDocker was popular -- GitLab and Mattermost are two popular self-hosted products\\nthat still support Omnibus-based deployments today. It\'s still used in many\\ncases where Docker can\'t be used (on the \\\\*BSDs, for example).\\n\\nBut, since Omnibus is [effectively EOL in 2024](https://docs.chef.io/versions/)\\ndue to its reliance on Chef Infra Client, we\'ve decided to deprioritize\\nreliance on it, and dedicate those resources to containerized deployments\\ninstead.\\n\\n**Note**: Beginning with 0.6, Omnibus support in Firezone is **deprecated**.\\nWe\'ll be removing support for it completely in a future Firezone release.\\n\\n#### How to migrate from Omnibus to Docker\\n\\nWe\'ve written an in-depth migration guide to migrate your instance from Omnibus\\nto Docker:\\n\\nhttps://www.firezone.dev/docs/administer/migrate\\n\\nMost instances will migrate without issue. If you\'re running Firezone in production\\nfor your team or business, [contact us](/contact/support)\\nso we can better understand how we can help with your migration.\\n\\n### SAML 2.0\\n\\nAlso in 0.6 is preliminary support for SAML 2.0 authentication. You\'ll need the\\nIdP Metadata XML document to set it up. In most cases the identity provider\\nwill provide it for you. If not, you should be able to build it manually or\\nusing a tool such as\\n[this nifty online IdP builder](https://www.samltool.com/idp_metadata.php).\\n\\nIn general we recommend using OpenID Connect integration over SAML whenever possible.\\nIt\'s simpler, tends to be implemented more consistently across identity providers,\\nand much easier to debug when things go wrong.\\n\\nSpeaking of OIDC, 0.6 also introduces a couple improvements to make integrating\\nyour identity provider a more pleasant experience:\\n\\n- `auto_create_oidc_users` is now a per-provider configuration setting. Enable or disable\\n  autocreation of users when logging into Firezone via that provider.\\n- New web form for entering OIDC details, with improved validation and error checking:\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"500\\"\\n    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167144/196735853-b2c8d505-285f-40ac-9d73-4b568358c5c3.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"OIDC Form\\"\\n  />\\n</center>\\n\\n#### IdP not supported?\\n\\nIf your IdP isn\'t supported or you\'d like to learn about your options for\\ncustom integrations, [contact us](/contact/support) to learn more about custom integrations."},{"id":"release-0-5-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-0-5-0","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-25-release-0-5-0/index.mdx","title":"Release 0.5.0","description":"Firezone 0.5 Released!","date":"2022-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 25, 2022","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"beta","permalink":"/blog/tags/beta"},{"label":"acme","permalink":"/blog/tags/acme"},{"label":"reverse proxy","permalink":"/blog/tags/reverse-proxy"},{"label":"docs","permalink":"/blog/tags/docs"}],"readingTime":3.58,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jamil Bou Kheir","title":"Co-founder","url":"https://github.com/jamilbk","imageURL":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c8434814eec26026718e992322648c8","key":"jamil"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-0-5-0","title":"Release 0.5.0","authors":["jamil"],"tags":["release","beta","acme","reverse proxy","docs"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Release 0.6.0","permalink":"/blog/release-0-6-0"}},"content":"## Firezone 0.5 Released!\\n\\nAs the first post on our new blog, we thought it\'d be fitting to kick things\\noff with a release announcement. So without further ado, we\'re excited to\\nannounce: Firezone [0.5.0 is\\nhere](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)! \xa0It\'s packed with new\\nfeatures, bug fixes, and other improvements \u2014 more on that below.\\n\\n### User-scoped egress rules\\n\\nRules can now optionally receive a user scope, limiting the rule\'s application\\nonly to devices owned by that user. This allows you to selectively allow or\\ndeny traffic from a particular user to an IP, set of IPs, or CIDR range.\\n\\n### Auto-renewed, ECDSA-backed, ACME-powered SSL certificates\\n\\nOne of our most-requested features is now available \u2014 Firezone 0.5.0 supports\\nACME SSL certificate renewal backed by Let\'s Encrypt\'s new ECDSA key type.\\nOther providers and key types are available too. See all ACME configuration\\noptions in our [configuration file\\nreference](/docs/reference/configuration-file/).\\n\\n**Note**: ACME is disabled by default to remain compatible with existing\\nFirezone installations. To enable, set the following in your config file:\\n\\n```\\ndefault[\'firezone\'][\'ssl\'][\'acme\'][\'enabled\'] = true\\n```\\n\\n### BYORP: Bring Your Own Reverse Proxy\\n\\nWant to disable Nginx and deploy Firezone under your own reverse proxy or HTTP\\nload balancer? Well, now you can! We\'ve documented the required headers and\\nother configuration necessary to make this happen. [Check the\\ndocs](/docs/deploy/advanced/reverse-proxy) for some configuration\\nexamples for popular proxies. In short:\\n\\nSet the\\n`default[\'firezone\'][\'phoenix\'][\'external_trusted_proxies\']`\\nconfiguration variable to a comma-separated list containing the proxies\\nyou\'d like to receive forwarded requests from. If your proxy uses an\\n[RFC1918 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network), add its\\nIP to `default[\'firezone\'][\'phoenix\'][\'private_clients\']` instead of\\n`default[\'firezone\'][\'phoenix\'][\'external_trusted_proxies\']`.\\nUpdate your proxy\'s configuration to point to Firezone, making sure to set\\nthe `X-Forwarded-For` header and enable WebSocket connection upgrades.\\n\\n**Note:** ACME support is tied to Nginx. If you disable the bundled\\nFirezone Nginx service, you\'ll need to provide your own SSL certificates\\n(or configure ACME renewal manually).\\n\\n**Additional note:** If you go this route, you\'ll need to terminate SSL\\nyourself \u2014 Firezone sets the secure attribute on all cookies and thus\\nrequires the downstream proxy to terminate SSL.\\n\\n### Runtime configuration available in the UI\\n\\nSome Firezone configuration settings are now configurable in the product UI\\nunder the Security settings. This will override anything you have set in the\\nconfig file. Moving runtime configuration into the application itself brings us\\na step closer to Docker-based deployments (coming Soon\u2122).\\n\\n### New and improved documentation\\n\\nOur docs have been migrated from Jekyll to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).\\nAside from all the Formatting is improved, user guides are updated and many\\npages have been edited for clarify and further detail. As an added bonus, our\\ndocs are feature improved search thanks to the powerful search functionality\\nprovided by [DocSearch by Algolia](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).\\nContributions welcome!\\n\\n### Red Hat and Debian package repositories\\n\\nIf you\'re on one of our [supported\\ndistros](/docs/deploy/omnibus/supported-platforms/) (or its\\nderivatives), the one-line install script will automatically install Firezone\\nfrom our package repository and track further updates from there. This means\\nyour Firezone installation can be managed like any other package on your system\\nand will be marked for upgrades by the same apt and yum tools you\'re already\\nfamiliar with. Be sure to check the [upgrade\\nnotes](/docs/administer/upgrade/) prior to each\\nupgrade in case there are any backwards-incompatible changes or manual steps\\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you\'ve got an existing installation and still want to add our package\\nrepository for easier package management, just follow the [relevant\\nsection](/docs/deploy/omnibus) in the manual\\ninstall guide.\\n\\n### Smaller package sizes\\n\\nSpeaking of packages, we\'ve done a bit of work reducing the size of our Omnibus\\nrelease package. The Nodejs, Python, Erlang, and Elixir runtimes have all been\\nremoved, reducing the package size by 50% and total installed size by even\\nmore. There\'s still lots of work to be done to be done here \u2014 \xa0we expect\\npackage sizes to be reduced even further moving forward.\\n\\n### Custom landing page logo\\n\\nIn the first round of what we hope to be the start of a full-featured\\ncustomization experience, it\'s now possible to change the landing page logo.\\nUpload an image up to 1 MB or specify a URL to an image your end users will see\\nwhen landing at your Firezone portal.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThat\'s all we\'ve got for now. If you\'d like to spin up Firezone to try it out,\\nhead to the [deploy guide](/docs/deploy) in our docs."}]}')}}]);
