Our [\\nautomatic install script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_install.sh)\\nnow uses Docker by default, and we even have a new [Docker migration script\\n](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firezone/firezone/master/scripts/docker_migrate.sh)\\nthat will non-destructively migrate your Omnibus-based Firezone installation\\nto a Docker-based one with minimal downtime.\\n\\n#### How to Deploy\\n\\nYou can now deploy Firezone complete with valid SSL certificates and a\\nprovisioned administrator in just a couple minutes:\\n\\n<AsciinemaPlayer\\n  src=\\"https://asciinema.org/a/530197.cast\\"\\n  autoplay={true}\\n  rows={30}\\n  idleTimeLimit={3}\\n  preload={true}\\n/>\\n\\nThis also means Firezone runs on any platform that supports Docker,\\nlike my Mac in the video above. The automatic install script will _probably_\\nbarf on Windows, though. In that case, try the\\n[manual install method](/docs/deploy/docker/#option-2-manual-install)!\\n\\n#### Why Docker?\\n\\nDocker offers a number of benefits over the old Omnibus-based method of deploying\\nFirezone:\\n\\n- **Simpler, more robust upgrades**: In most cases, simply pull the latest `firezone/firezone`\\n  image and restart the container.\\n- **Simpler configuration**: Most day-to-day configuration of Firezone can now\\n  be done in the web UI instead of the `/etc/firezone/firezone.rb` configuration\\n  file. All other configuration variables can be specified as ENV vars to the\\n  Firezone container.\\n- **Smaller footprint**: The Firezone image weighs in at a couple dozen\\n  megabytes versus hundreds of megabytes for the Omnibus package.\\n- **Portability**: Firezone now runs on any platform that supports Docker.\\n- **Security**: Containerization providers better security isolation than\\n  simply running as an unprivileged local user.\\n\\nIt also makes it easier to build and test Firezone. CI pipelines rejoice!\\nNo more 4-hour long compiles and intermittent build failures.\\n\\n#### What about Omnibus?\\n\\n[Chef Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus) is a Ruby-based build system\\ndesigned to make building and distributing complex software easier. You define\\nyour dependencies as source tarballs, configure options, and platform-specific\\nbuild flags, and Omnibus automatically fetches, builds, and links all your\\ndependencies automagically, emitting an OS-native installer artifact when\\ncomplete.\\n\\nOmnibus was a popular choice for distributing self-hosted software before\\nDocker was popular -- GitLab and Mattermost are two popular self-hosted products\\nthat still support Omnibus-based deployments today. It\'s still used in many\\ncases where Docker can\'t be used (on the \\\\*BSDs, for example).\\n\\nBut, since Omnibus is [effectively EOL in 2024](https://docs.chef.io/versions/)\\ndue to its reliance on Chef Infra Client, we\'ve decided to deprioritize\\nreliance on it, and dedicate those resources to containerized deployments\\ninstead.\\n\\n**Note**: Beginning with 0.6, Omnibus support in Firezone is **deprecated**.\\nWe\'ll be removing support for it completely in a future Firezone release.\\n\\n#### How to migrate from Omnibus to Docker\\n\\nWe\'ve written an in-depth migration guide to migrate your instance from Omnibus\\nto Docker:\\n\\nhttps://www.firezone.dev/docs/administer/migrate\\n\\nMost instances will migrate without issue. If you\'re running Firezone in production\\nfor your team or business, [contact us](/contact/support)\\nso we can better understand how we can help with your migration.\\n\\n### SAML 2.0\\n\\nAlso in 0.6 is preliminary support for SAML 2.0 authentication. You\'ll need the\\nIdP Metadata XML document to set it up. In most cases the identity provider\\nwill provide it for you. If not, you should be able to build it manually or\\nusing a tool such as\\n[this nifty online IdP builder](https://www.samltool.com/idp_metadata.php).\\n\\nIn general we recommend using OpenID Connect integration over SAML whenever possible.\\nIt\'s simpler, tends to be implemented more consistently across identity providers,\\nand much easier to debug when things go wrong.\\n\\nSpeaking of OIDC, 0.6 also introduces a couple improvements to make integrating\\nyour identity provider a more pleasant experience:\\n\\n- `auto_create_oidc_users` is now a per-provider configuration setting. Enable or disable\\n  autocreation of users when logging into Firezone via that provider.\\n- New web form for entering OIDC details, with improved validation and error checking:\\n\\n<center>\\n  <img\\n    width=\\"500\\"\\n    src=\\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/167144/196735853-b2c8d505-285f-40ac-9d73-4b568358c5c3.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"OIDC Form\\"\\n  />\\n</center>\\n\\n#### IdP not supported?\\n\\nIf your IdP isn\'t supported or you\'d like to learn about your options for\\ncustom integrations, [contact us](/contact/support) to learn more about custom integrations."},{"id":"release-0-5-0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/release-0-5-0","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-25-release-0-5-0/index.mdx","title":"Release 0.5.0","description":"Firezone 0.5 Released!","date":"2022-07-25T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 25, 2022","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"beta","permalink":"/blog/tags/beta"},{"label":"acme","permalink":"/blog/tags/acme"},{"label":"reverse proxy","permalink":"/blog/tags/reverse-proxy"},{"label":"docs","permalink":"/blog/tags/docs"}],"readingTime":3.58,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Jamil Bou Kheir","title":"Co-founder","url":"https://github.com/jamilbk","imageURL":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c8434814eec26026718e992322648c8","key":"jamil"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"release-0-5-0","title":"Release 0.5.0","authors":["jamil"],"tags":["release","beta","acme","reverse proxy","docs"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Release 0.6.0","permalink":"/blog/release-0-6-0"}},"content":"## Firezone 0.5 Released!\\n\\nAs the first post on our new blog, we thought it\'d be fitting to kick things\\noff with a release announcement. So without further ado, we\'re excited to\\nannounce: Firezone [0.5.0 is\\nhere](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/releases)! \xa0It\'s packed with new\\nfeatures, bug fixes, and other improvements \u2014 more on that below.\\n\\n### User-scoped egress rules\\n\\nRules can now optionally receive a user scope, limiting the rule\'s application\\nonly to devices owned by that user. This allows you to selectively allow or\\ndeny traffic from a particular user to an IP, set of IPs, or CIDR range.\\n\\n### Auto-renewed, ECDSA-backed, ACME-powered SSL certificates\\n\\nOne of our most-requested features is now available \u2014 Firezone 0.5.0 supports\\nACME SSL certificate renewal backed by Let\'s Encrypt\'s new ECDSA key type.\\nOther providers and key types are available too. See all ACME configuration\\noptions in our [configuration file\\nreference](/docs/reference/configuration-file/).\\n\\n**Note**: ACME is disabled by default to remain compatible with existing\\nFirezone installations. To enable, set the following in your config file:\\n\\n```\\ndefault[\'firezone\'][\'ssl\'][\'acme\'][\'enabled\'] = true\\n```\\n\\n### BYORP: Bring Your Own Reverse Proxy\\n\\nWant to disable Nginx and deploy Firezone under your own reverse proxy or HTTP\\nload balancer? Well, now you can! We\'ve documented the required headers and\\nother configuration necessary to make this happen. [Check the\\ndocs](/docs/deploy/advanced/reverse-proxy) for some configuration\\nexamples for popular proxies. In short:\\n\\nSet the\\n`default[\'firezone\'][\'phoenix\'][\'external_trusted_proxies\']`\\nconfiguration variable to a comma-separated list containing the proxies\\nyou\'d like to receive forwarded requests from. If your proxy uses an\\n[RFC1918 address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network), add its\\nIP to `default[\'firezone\'][\'phoenix\'][\'private_clients\']` instead of\\n`default[\'firezone\'][\'phoenix\'][\'external_trusted_proxies\']`.\\nUpdate your proxy\'s configuration to point to Firezone, making sure to set\\nthe `X-Forwarded-For` header and enable WebSocket connection upgrades.\\n\\n**Note:** ACME support is tied to Nginx. If you disable the bundled\\nFirezone Nginx service, you\'ll need to provide your own SSL certificates\\n(or configure ACME renewal manually).\\n\\n**Additional note:** If you go this route, you\'ll need to terminate SSL\\nyourself \u2014 Firezone sets the secure attribute on all cookies and thus\\nrequires the downstream proxy to terminate SSL.\\n\\n### Runtime configuration available in the UI\\n\\nSome Firezone configuration settings are now configurable in the product UI\\nunder the Security settings. This will override anything you have set in the\\nconfig file. Moving runtime configuration into the application itself brings us\\na step closer to Docker-based deployments (coming Soon\u2122).\\n\\n### New and improved documentation\\n\\nOur docs have been migrated from Jekyll to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).\\nAside from all the Formatting is improved, user guides are updated and many\\npages have been edited for clarify and further detail. As an added bonus, our\\ndocs are feature improved search thanks to the powerful search functionality\\nprovided by [DocSearch by Algolia](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).\\nContributions welcome!\\n\\n### Red Hat and Debian package repositories\\n\\nIf you\'re on one of our [supported\\ndistros](/docs/deploy/omnibus/supported-platforms/) (or its\\nderivatives), the one-line install script will automatically install Firezone\\nfrom our package repository and track further updates from there. This means\\nyour Firezone installation can be managed like any other package on your system\\nand will be marked for upgrades by the same apt and yum tools you\'re already\\nfamiliar with. Be sure to check the [upgrade\\nnotes](/docs/administer/upgrade/) prior to each\\nupgrade in case there are any backwards-incompatible changes or manual steps\\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you\'ve got an existing installation and still want to add our package\\nrepository for easier package management, just follow the [relevant\\nsection](/docs/deploy/omnibus) in the manual\\ninstall guide.\\n\\n### Smaller package sizes\\n\\nSpeaking of packages, we\'ve done a bit of work reducing the size of our Omnibus\\nrelease package. The Nodejs, Python, Erlang, and Elixir runtimes have all been\\nremoved, reducing the package size by 50% and total installed size by even\\nmore. There\'s still lots of work to be done to be done here \u2014 \xa0we expect\\npackage sizes to be reduced even further moving forward.\\n\\n### Custom landing page logo\\n\\nIn the first round of what we hope to be the start of a full-featured\\ncustomization experience, it\'s now possible to change the landing page logo.\\nUpload an image up to 1 MB or specify a URL to an image your end users will see\\nwhen landing at your Firezone portal.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThat\'s all we\'ve got for now. If you\'d like to spin up Firezone to try it out,\\nhead to the [deploy guide](/docs/deploy) in our docs."}]}')}}]);
